Review
I have dry skin and was looking for a moisturizing spray to use as something to freshen up and hydrate my skin throughout the day. While this is fairly moisturizing, it has a very strong perfume smell. I used it regardless, even though I don't really care for the smell, and it broke me out.I use heavy moisturizer every day and I'm not particularly acne prone but this stuff gives me automatic chin and cheek acne. I'll stick with more affordable rose water spray.Hard pass.
I first saw this product from a beauty influencer online who I trust (Tina Tanaka Harris), it’s clear how much she genuinely loves this product.I really wanted to love it because functionally it works exactly as I wanted it to, and the ingredient formulation is the best for any spray serum, BUT: it smells like you got sprayed in the face at the mall perfume counter. Like walking into a Macy’s while peeling an orange. If that’s your thing that’s great but I can’t deal with lingering strong perfumes. Another reviewer mentioned it smells like grandma perfume and I was hoping they were going to be wrong… but it’s exactly right. It smells exactly like a perfume my late grandma wore which is nostalgic but not something I can use unfortunately. It also doesn’t fade quickly and even if you wash it off soon after spraying it your skin will still smell like it.The smell alone is not a reason that Amazon will accept as a refund request so I suggest if you’re on the fence about not knowing if you’ll like the scent of this product, then don’t get it. It’s such as shame because if this brand made a version with no parfum added or fragrance free, it would sell very well. I would buy it in a heartbeat.But I assume most people attracted to this product are wanting the sensory experience of the perfume, so if that’s you, you will genuinely enjoy this product.
I wanted to like this product due to its hype but, I cannot get over the perfume smell it has. I’ve used it a handful of times but have since stopped and will probably never pick it up again. I don’t know how anyone puts up with the fragrance, and usually I am not one to care for skincare fragrances but this just smells like I’m spraying straight up fragrance/perfume on my face. The few times I did use this I didn’t notice a difference at all. I think there are WAYYYY better products out there with less fragrance or no fragrance that is more enjoyable to use. Save your money buy something else!
I really wanted to like this , great reviews. The smell was overwhelming!  imagine spraying perfume on my face . Couldn’t get rid of smell. Had to wash face again. Not sure if it’s hydrating couldn’t use.
While it has a lovely smell and applies beautifully, I noticed that it caused my face to  breakout. I've found that using it on arms works perfectly for me! Just not the best fit for my face so I probably won’t buy again.Also, make sure to shake before EVERY use.
The hydration level is good, although after a couple of weeks of continuous use, day and night, it started to irritate my skin. Could have been the fragrance idk.
This product is super popular right now and big named people are doing sponsorships so I really wanted to try and had high hopes. IMO it’s not worth the hype or price tag. $26 for some glowy skin is not the vibe for 2023/2024 at all. It tastes horrible! If you get it on your lips which you will everytime it literally tastes like nail polish remover. The smell I can get over but not the taste it’s gross. Furthermore I don’t even notice the product doing much. I used as a skincare step and setting spray like all the influencers say to and there was a slight glow to my skin but nothing you can’t achieve with a smaller price tag and it also broke out my forehead which was otherwise clear. I don’t know, I’m just not into it and think that being $26 it’s not worth the hype. To add, leaving my review I notice the price has changed and is now $18. That’s kinda unfair that a product would fluctuate in price constantly. I’d probably return it if it wasn’t such a hassle. Pretty bummed!
How dare you charge the same $ fior 1 ozAs the same as 6 oz.
To be honest, this is another product that is just hyped up by the influencers. We spend our hard earned money, while they make money pushing this mediocre product. I’m sorry, but nothing is special about this spray. I’m mad at myself because once I again I fell for another product that is recommended and it’s nothing great.
When I purchased this I was super excited about bringing another level of moisture to my morning routine. After the 1st use my skin felt itchy in a couple of spots. So I stopped. However,  keep in mind everyone's skin needs and issues are different. Just using it in my hands I could feel the difference the product brings to the skin. This product I feel would be great for younger skin20, 30 or 40 and can be introduced in a new routine. It's just not for me and my current facial needs.
A bunch of influencers were recommending this and really talking this up, I should have known better because almost every one of the videos were sponsored. This is highly fragranced and started to cause little irritation bumps on my skin. I do have very sensitive/dry skin and mild rosacea and this did not agree with my skin at all. I can see this really working for someone who isn’t as sensitive/dry as me. The whole experience of it is nice but unfortunately it just didn’t work for me.
I don't understand why this is popular. This is just the same as any other ones on the market, I can even get cheaper ones like La-Roche...
Smells good but did absolutely nothing for my skin.
I love this product 3rd time buying but I am not happy with the small bottle. Thought it was larger.
I got sucked in by utube. My skin has no glow. Still as dry as ever.
No me gustó como deja la piel, la deja con aspecto grasoso y muy brillante y adicional me generaba ardor en algunas zonas de mi cara, seguramente porque soy de piel sensible.
I truly don’t understand the hype. First, there’s A LOT of fragrance, it’s like a perfume. While it does visually glow my skin, it’s SO drying. I didn’t do enough research so I overlooked that it had hyaluronic acid (my mistake). HA is actually not good for your skin as it attracts water and pulls the moisture from your skin to the surface. I physically felt my skin start to dry out. The glow mostly comes from the oil diluted in the product. I think you can make something like this on your own without the added fragrance. Just add water mixed with some oil in a mister. Anyway, I really wanted to like it but it just didn’t give what it was advertised to do.
I hace acne prone skin and this broke me out
At first i thought i liked it. But then when you are using it as a setting spray, your face stays wet. Your hair will stick to your face, it just feels extremely uncomfortable. And i have very dry skin so i thought this was going to be a game changer. I think I’ve used too much now to return it. Idk if the pink bottle would be better or this is a flawed bottle but i won’t repurchase
Tal vez sea mi piel que e demasiado sensible pero este producto me irritó demasiado la piel de la cara no fue mi mejor experiencia usarla.
Not give a glow at all.The oil parts always stays on top. Mixture look weird. All instruction and evertything is in chinese. Not impressed at allI don't know if this is a cipy of the original one or this is it?
I wanted to like this product, but it broke me out. It smells good and makes the skin very shinny, but It gave me acne and clogged my pores a lot. I have combination skin and I would say my skin is very resilient. If you have very dry skin this may work for you, but it did nothing but smelled good and gave me acne.
Recommended by an influencerNothing special
I’m going to keep the spray to see if the hype is worth it, but honestly , the fragrance is like perfume and completely unnecessary, especially in something you spray on your face.  I’m curious to see if I’ll have a reaction because I have sensitive skin.  I don’t k ow why fragrance is put in any facial product …  I will not buy again for this reason
I wanted to love this stuff . Though this stuffed burn my face and irritated it so bad.  My face felt like I had stand in the sun all day . I couldnt wear makeup for about a week .
"I'm picky and this did not deliver. I have been looking for a replacement for Belif Aqua Bomb Mist which has been discontinued. I was hoping this would deliver moisture and that ""glow"". It did not. It's okay, but just ok."
No me resultó me salieron muchos granitos ☹️☹️
I apply I don’t see no difference
Does not work.  Returned
I wanted to love this so much because I loved the original version, and I love the idea that this is vegan — plus, this version was on Sale while the other was not!unfortunately, I’ve sprayed it on my face on three separate occasions, and every time it’s made me red & itchy, without any other benefits.I really wish I would’ve just ponied up the $ for the original version, because it’s much better.
I have clear blemish free skin and upon using this I broke out in whiteheads for 2-3 weeks.  Went away after I stopped using this spray.  This is definitely not good for skin as it clogs pores.  Rather than returning I now use it for my hair—-at best, it tames flyaways and static.m and smells kinda nice.  Not worth over 25 bucks for sure!  Buyers beware!
Tight fitting. Size runs small. Sizing is one position off. A 2X More like an extra large and an extra large is more like a large.
When I went to Korea, I got this serum as a gift from my friend and used it. I fell in love with it because the scent was so good.  I used a whole bottle. I ended up buying this product from Amazon. The scent is completely different. Has the scent changed? The one I received in korea had a flower scent, it smells like male cologne....
I was excited to try this. Under makeup, over makeup. After a good wash. Bottle is beautiful and cute packaging. Smell is terrible lol. I really did not see any change in my skin or makeup application. Feels good to put on (but water feels the same??). I returned it. Too much money to spend just to dampen my face.
Not worth the buy, I don’t like the way it dries down. It’s only a glowy look because it’s freshly sprayed but I wouldn’t say it adds any additional hydration you couldn’t get with a thermal spray for less.
Is smells like a men cologne, and it refreshes gibes the glow look but isnt hydrating ad ai thought
Nada del otro mundo para el precio
No hace ninguna diferencia en mi rostro, actúa igual que un agua de rosas!
When sprayed on face and neck it is a very fine and light mist. It is very pleasant and leaves your face feeling like xtra hydrated. I feel it has a long lasting effect that I really loved.My biggest issue with this product is the smell. I was really hoping to not have strong perfume smell, but it does. Some may like this, but I do not. It gives me a head ache and leads to me being unable to use the product at all. Very sad and I would buy again if the scent formula was changed.
I love the product. But I have a bad breakout . It’s been years since I have an acne  and when I used this serum I have a bad breakout.  Not good for me at all
I bought this because a YouTuber convinced me I needed it. It left my face oily and sticky.  I can’t imagine using this AFTER I put on makeup as a setting spray.  Bottom line, everybody’s face/skin is different, what works for you may not work for me.  This did not work for me at all! I have normal skin but if you have dry, really dry skin, maybe this is for you.
I tried this product after seeing so many reviews on it and was unpleasantly surprised at how despite after shaking it vigorously for at least a minute on separate occasions, it felt like water was being sprayed and it didn’t make my skin look any different - if anything my skin got red and irritated..
Did not see much improvement, and need like 12+ sprays to see any temporary dewy look.  There are other products out there that have been way more effective for me.
I am glad I tested it on my forearm first because the smell isn’t tolerable for me. I had to return it. There is “fragrance” listed in the ingredients. I think it smells like a deep musk perfume and reminds me of something my great aunt would wear. I wish they could make one that’s fragrance free!
I wanted to love this spray like so many others but the fragrance is unpleasant. It smells like after shave for old men.
Definitely not worth $35, it has avocado oil that clog pours. Smells refreshing and it’s a spray so you can easily use it to moisturize.
Entirely too fragrant! It lingers in the air and overwhelms the senses. A fragrance free version is badly needed.
Made me feel like a grease ball and I broke out so bad. Would be great for dry skin ONLY.
Don’t waste your money didn’t see any difference. Is like just wetting your face with water.
The face looks much the same as before the spray . The video of the advertising was very convenient.  But it's definitely not Like that
I have sensitive and acne prone skin. Made me look like I had beautiful glass skin but then started to feel a burning sensation and made my face red 😭 so sad bc would’ve been a great product
I use it for one day and had a whitehead the next day. Also the fragrance is not needed, in my opinion. It interferes with my fragrance. I think I will use the product for my hair instead.
This was recommended by an utube influencer.  I did not like it at all.  I kept trying and trying..I wanted to like it but it irritated my skin and dried it out..
I didn’t see any difference by using this product. Don’t waste your money, it’s not worth it
my skin feels dry after using this.Smells good tho.
This is another social media hype. It hasn’t done anything at all considering the claims. Would I ever buy this again? That would be a solid no.
Really wanted to like this but it made me break out..
Don’t see a change nor improvement. I would not buy it again.
I purchased the Vegan First Spray and it makes my skin look amazing and feels great on the skin. However, I just cannot continue to use it. The fragrance is so intense that it made me nauseated and triggered a migraine. I never get migraines. Very bummed because I love how it looks and feels.
Doesn’t last long glow effect
It was kinda sticky. Not suitable for mine
Broke out my post accutane skin, which is wild because products usually can’t get that typa reaction out of me anymore. Smells horrible, but just trying to use as a body serum to get through it.
Feels good no shine it doesnt last
Just a sticky, tacky spray that does nothing that I can tell.
The scent is too strong. Made me sick to smell it.
I normally have really clear skin and this made my face break out
It dies not do what they are saying it will no glow at all
I don’t feel like this is worth the money. I bought it when this influencer raved about it. I’ll finish it. It’s just okay. Not worth the money.
I didn't like this product after a few days of use, I got a rash on my face. I didn't use it for a few days and everything passed, but when I decided to use it again, I started to have a rash on my face again.
توقعت أنه سيجعل الوجه لامعا لكن للأسف ليس له أي تأثير
保湿に関しては気休め程度なので、期待しない方がいいです。匂いが強いので、あまり良い商品だとは思いませんでした。
"I was so excited and hopeful for this spray. I had heard so many good reviews about it. But after day one of using it, my whole face had tiny bumps, rashy, itchy and felt hot to touch. This spray is heavily perfumed so anyone with sensitive skin like me and many others, may be best to steer clear of it. I'm so disappointed that I spent so much on this and have to just chuck it. Stick to more gentle products and not ""trends"" such as these."
Lo llevo usando a diario en mi rutina, mañana y noche, desde que lo recibí hace cosa de un mes y no puedo decir nada especial de este.No noto mayor hidratación, la textura de la piel no cambia ni a mejor, ni a peor.Aporta cierta luminosidad pero no creo que sea algo especialmente reseñable.Por su precio creo que hay serums o cremas que aportan más.Lo seguiré usando pero no creo que repita.Es agradable en la textura y el fresco que aporta a la piel al pulverizarlo, pero no puedo destacar nada más.
Riecht gut sieht gut aus und man fühlt sich gut wenn man es aufsprüht aber tut nichts für meine Haut.  Würde ich niemandem empfehlen . Dann lieber hyaluron und ein Feuchtigkeitsspray drunter
前回購入した時の販売元は東京で、今回届いたものは大阪でした。今回の商品はスプレーの出方がまだらでおかしかったです。本物なのかどうか不安になりました、、
保湿感は出ます。気軽にお風呂上がりにスプレーできるのも良いです。探し求めてた商品なのに。臭い！臭すぎる！子供の頃嗅いで臭いなと思った母や祖母の化粧品、おじいちゃんの香水の匂い……効果云々より臭いが無理！使えない……でもそれ以外の使用感は今のとこいいので匂いがなんでもいい人にはおすすめです……
This product is really nice but expensive ordered it one day the next day half price same company tried to return it and order cheaper one but was not allowed
気に入っていて３回目のリピート購入でしたが、今回届いたスプレーはオイルが漏れていました。箱にまでシミがあり、本品のフタもオイルまみれ。気に入っていただけに、残念です。
I wanted to like this based on  reviews, but I had to return it.  It's VERY scented, not lightly scented and my skin hated it and had a reaction to it.  If you have very sensitive skin, think twice about using it.
Me decidí a comprarlo por las buenas reseñas q tenía y me ha decepcionado. Yo utilizo un maquillaje muy denso pero q no es malo(steel lauder doble wear) y aunque me encanta, apaga mucho la piel entoces pensé q este producto sería la solución pero no fue así. Es más, me deja la cara como a manchas, como si no hubiese extendido bien el maquillaje. Probé a echarlo antes de maquillarme pero como si no echase nada. Igual no causa efecto en todas las pieles. Yo reconozco q no pude conseguir el efecto q deseaba.
あまりにもInstagramでみかけるので、購入しましたが自分的には匂いが好きではないです。お祖母ちゃんとかを彷彿させる匂いに思えました。1度プッシュしたっきり　棚にしまいました。このまま捨てるんだろうなと思います。
バズってて買って使ってみようと思ったのですが使い始めてから約2ヶ月間効果がわからないですいい匂いですが使ったあと微妙にベタベタしますが肌に効果的ではないと思いますトリュフ入ってるのは確かおしゃれですがだったらトリュフナッツ食べればよかったと言うところです…
Ich kann das Produkt nicht empfehlen und sehe keine Veränderung im Hautbild. Klarer Fehlkauf 😏
It smells good other than that I didn't notice anything different in my skin.Won't buy again.
No lo recomiendo para las personas con piel seca tirando a normal.Antes de usar el producto tenía la piel sin granos,y llevo unas semanas usándolo y me ha destrozado la cara. Al menos a mí no me ha funcionado.
"So first of all, this product has a LAUNDRY LIST of ingredients... it's actually crazy how many things they've crammed in there.The smell is okay. I find it fine when you spray it but then it lingers all day, has a sort of ""old lady"" floral scent.Hydration? I don't know. My skin felt the exact same. I tried spraying a bunch on the back of my hand... it felt kind of oily for a while and then absorbed to nothing.Lastly, this product states clearly to NOT INHALE when spraying it. I've never seen that in a setting spray in my life. That is super questionable to me. Also questionable is that they covered up the old warning label that says to ""hold your breath"" when spraying it.The stuff honestly just sketched me out, and the results weren't worth whatever risk it has for inhaling it. Weird. Be cautious...."
Use makeup setting spray instead
よくあるおじさんの香水の匂いです。自分の顔からこの匂いが香ってくるのは無理でした。韓国のオリーブヤングで、テスターを手に吹きかけた時はこんな香りしなかったような…。ミストは割と大きめ？荒め？ですが、目にかかってしまっても沁みなかったです。キュレルのミストよりはオイルが入っているので乾燥はしにくいかなと思います。使用感は悪くないですが、香りが衝撃的すぎて同じような製品もたくさんあるので、わざわざこれを買う必要はないかなと思いました。匂いに少しでも敏感な方は本当にやめた方がいいです。マスクする前にこれ吹きかけたらマジで地獄。
No le veo nada de especial
No me parece un producto bueno. El olor es de cosmético barato, si te pulverizas agua con ese compuesto aceitoso es normal lo de la piel jugosa. No lo volvería a comprar
It’s a spray I’m not sure what the hype is al about the fact that people say they get “glass skin” is hilarious of course you do! You’re getting wet!!!! Returning I will stick to tatcha yes it’s more expensive but I like the ACTUAL dewy look I get from it and I don’t have to spray it 17 times LOL believe what you want but for me it’s basic..
I had heard all so much good stuff about this and after going through the bottle half way, i say save your money it leaves a weird after texture to the skin.After using it for a bit lightly yet consistently I started breaking out, the glow is a light shine but barely visible unless heavy coating which didn't work on my skin.
Lo compré por la publicidad y la composición que me pareció bastante buena, pero la sensación pegajosa que se queda en la piel es muy incómoda y no me gusta. Quizá en invierno no pase, pero en verano fatal.
Satisfecha
The product is fine but not having extra ordinary results. Might not buy again
El producto está bien normalito lo veo caro y no lo volveré a comprar
It just water with something.  My face is the same after the application.
Sinceramente se han lucido en publicidad y no es más que un agüita que además saca granos !!
No deja ese efecto flow que todos dicen. Es un tónico como hay muchos, muy caro para lo que es.
Lo venden como un producto que deja la piel radiante e hidratada.... Yo no noto nada y lo aplico antes de la crema y después del maquillaje
