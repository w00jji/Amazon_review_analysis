Review
I recently incorporated a beauty spray into my skincare routine, and I can't help but share my positive experience with this remarkable product. Not only does it deliver on its promises, but it has also garnered me countless compliments on my skin's appearance.**Efficacy:**The beauty spray truly does what it says—providing an instant boost of brightness and glow to my skin. Upon first use, I noticed a refreshing, radiant finish that transformed my complexion from dull to revitalized. This spray has become my go-to product for adding that extra luminosity, whether I’m preparing for a busy day or an evening out.**Ingredients:**I've looked into the ingredient list, and it's impressive. The blend includes hydrating components like hyaluronic acid and soothing botanical extracts that not only enhance brightness but also nourish the skin. Knowing that the formula is both effective and beneficial gives me confidence in using it regularly.**Application Process:**The application is straightforward and enjoyable. The fine mist dispenses evenly, providing a refreshing sensation without any sticky residue. I typically use it throughout the day, either over my makeup or on bare skin, and it instantly revitalizes my look without disturbing my makeup base.**Results:**One of the best aspects of this beauty spray is the consistency of results. Every time I use it, I am met with a luminous finish that has drawn compliments from friends and family alike. This boost in confidence is priceless; I find myself feeling more self-assured and glowing, which reflects in my overall demeanor.**Portability:**Additionally, the size of the spray bottle makes it highly portable. I can easily toss it in my bag for either a quick refresh during the day or as part of my travel essentials. It’s great to know I can maintain that bright, beautiful finish anytime, anywhere.**Overall Impression:**In summary, this beauty spray has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, ease of use, and positive feedback from others. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to achieve brighter, healthier-looking skin. It truly delivers on its promises, making it a fantastic addition to any skincare routine. Don't be surprised if you start receiving compliments as soon as you start using it!
The Nice Truffle Mist Facial Spray is a luxurious addition to any skincare routine. Infused with truffle extract, it delivers a burst of hydration and a subtle, earthy scent that feels indulgent. The mist is fine and even, making it perfect for setting makeup or refreshing the skin throughout the day. Users rave about its soothing properties and how it leaves the skin with a dewy, glowing finish. A must-try for those looking to add a touch of elegance to their skincare regimen.
"I made this purchase on an influencer recommendation (James Welsh). This feels very refreshing, there is a slight fragrance, I can't put my finger on what it is, it is not offensive, rather clean smelling, leaves my skin feeling hydrated and glowing. I liked this so much that I ordered a second one (when Johnny Ross - who also gave it a good review told his audience that there was a discount being offered) before my first one was even 1/2 used (because there was a sale offered on it). I do have ""normal skin""."
The first day I used it I couldn’t believe how beautiful and glowing my face looked, I like to apply this first after washing my face and then i apply another face product, I  tried to apply after my other face product that I usually use every morning but i liked the results it gave me soo much better by applying this first!  it makes my face look so amazing, I also I noticed my make up foundation looks so much nicer and my face looks glowing and smooth.
So I'm a face care newbie at 52.  I've always had soft smooth skin and take basic care of it.  But now in my 50s, I am noticing more dryness and wrinkles and sun damage.  I don't usually like anything sprayed on my face, but during the day, when my face feels a bit dry or tight, I spray this on so it won't mess up my blush or eye make-up.  The mist is really fine, feels nice and smells nice.  It's a clear liquid with what looks like yellow truffle oil that floats on top.  I shake it up and give a couple of sprays on my face and neck.  It works really well to hydrate my face.
I rarely ever repurchase a skincare product that I find to be over my typical budget (the price on this spray fluctuates between 18-33 dollars constantly,) that is, until this product came along.I have combo/dry skin that gets super dry during winter, and oily yet parched during summer. I needed a spray that felt moisturizing yet sinks into skin seamlessly at the same time, and also made me feel refreshed. After seeing Tina Tanaka Harris rave about this spray in many of her videos, I ended up purchasing a bottle some time around early spring, and boy-was it love at first spritz. Immediately after mixing the bottle and spraying I knew I was going to love it. It moisturizes my skin to the point the cracks around my nose were kept at bay. At first it may appear greasy, but over time it dries into a smooth, velvety finish on my skin. And the smell, weirdly enough, does not bother me, (It has a nice, natural citrusy-smell, nothing chemical-smelling.) Lastly, the feeling of the spray on my skin just felt so luxurious and refreshing, I don't always have to spritz throughout the day, but when I do I'm in for a treat.The one MAJOR gripe I have about this product is the quantity/size. It comes in an average-sized bottle which personally I feel like doesn't match the pricing. I wish they had a bigger size, because I find myself constantly running out of the spray 4-6 weeks later, which RARELY ever happens when I use face sprays, (my alternative go-to is the Caudalie grape water, which has an even bigger bottle that has last me 6 months.) The ONLY reason why I'm willing to continue repurchasing is because the few times that I ran out I IMMEDIATELY could tell my skin felt different without it, and often not in a good way. With winter around the corner, it's even more crucial that I find a spray that is moisturizing enough for my skin once it starts changing.Overall, I'm giving this product a 5/5. It's a godsend for dry/combo skin, and often feels like a luxury experience in a bottle. The only downside I have is that I wish they came up with a jumbo size. I generally recommend to everyone, especially dry skin types.A little tip for oily skin types: If you find the spray to be greasy on your skin, I learned that not mixing the spray and just spritzing the watery part can work just as well without the oil. As for sensitive skin types, this mist does appear to have alcohol and parfume, but as someone who struggles with sensitivity I've yet to experience any negative side effects. That being said, always make sure to patch test any skincare product before applying incorporating it into your skincare as a precaution.
In the two short weeks that I’ve been using this product, I’ve already noticed a tremendous improvement and change in my skin. I’m a 48-year-old post-menopausal woman with mostly dry skin and larger pores with freckling and light scarring from acne in my younger years. I’ve tried to become more dedicated to taking care of my skin and creating a regular skincare routine, but not only do I tire of it, but my skin is fickle. What it likes today, and what works today, doesn’t tomorrow.Over the years, I have become more and more learned of Korean skincare, but I’ve ALWAYS LOVED “traditional” French/European skincare products, though they are SO expensive, and sometimes too heavy for my skin. This spray offers the BEST of both worlds. The delivery and approach and quality is very definitely Korean skincare-like. The ingredients, however, are very reminiscent of those found in French Provençal skincare… especially the truffles. The smell of the spray could be a perfume for those of us, who love the smell of the French Countryside. It’s Provence in a bottle.As for me, after cleansing (evening) or rinsing/refreshing (morning) my face and  décolletage, I will generously apply the spray to those areas and allow it to dry before moving on with the rest of my morning routine (sunscreen/moisturizer, then makeup), or just finishing up with that in the evening. I’ve been so impressed with this spray, however, that I am going to next purchase the serum/cream duo. I am just waiting for a good price, as I live on a more meager budget. Next time this spray goes on sale (I purchased the large bottle for $18.), I will purchase a couple of bottles.I hope you enjoy this product as much as do I, and as I experience more improvements, I will try to update my review.
My skin just LOVES this product.  I’m on my third bottle now.  If I’m too lazy to do makeup, I spray this product on my skin and it gives a beautiful glow!  Or when my skin feels dry, I love using this mist to give a quick hydrating pick me up.  Holy grail & I cannot do without.
I’m in love with this spray serum! I use this after washing my face at night and my skin eats this stuff up! Sometimes I’ll use it throughout the day over my makeup if my skin is feeling a bit dry. Highly recommend for those with dry, tight skin. It doesn’t feel oily either.
I was skeptical. But this product is exactly what I wanted. I have dry skin. And I am in the sun alot.I use this before my make up. After it's applied and I had to refresh. It has changed my skin and reduced the appearance of of my years on my face. I use it with the balm stick
I use this daily as a setting spray after I put on makeup.It smells amazing and really seal my makeup for the day.  It lasts hours until I go home from work.They have sold me and I am a true customer for life.
OMG!  Where has this been!  I love how my face looked after I spray this! Feels and looks refresh and my skin is softer and firmer! Love it! Next time I will buy the larger bottle!
I like this product it’s good for my sensitive skin doesn’t cause me to break out nice subtle glow does well on top of my other skin products
Was completely influenced to by this by Nikki La Rose and another YouTube makeup artist and I’m not mad about it. I have dry skin and have had issues with my makeup sticking to dry patches, flaking or just looking dull on my face. I like to do my makeup in a way that will have it last from morning all the way up to when I wash it off at the end of the night- which means I have my liquid/cream layer and powders over top. If you have dry skin like me you know that powders can often times just accentuate dryness and also appear cakey if not done correctly when applied over creams/liquids. Up until this point Charlotte tilbury was my go to setting spray because it has done the best at making my makeup look less makeupy, blending everything seamlessly and for the most part hiding my dryness. It wasn’t perfect but it was the best.THEN I was told about this stuff. Let me tell you, this will never not be in my arsenal of holy grails. I did my makeup as usual, experienced the few dry patches I sometimes run into even though I have done all the skin prepping and hydrating both nightly and morning before applying my makeup. I sprayed this on as my final step- shook it a few times and sprayed just 3 sprays on my face (that’s all you need trust me!) and Oh MY GOD- my makeup looks FLAWLESS.Again I use this as a setting spray so I can’t speak to its serum properties and what it does for bare skin- I’m sure it’s lovely- but it melted my creams/powders together in a way that completely erased pores and hid my fine lines. It doesn’t feel gross or heavy on the skin. It does have a bit of a scent that does last some time but it’s not offensive in anyway and my husband didn’t notice it.Overall, love this product I hope it never goes away. It’s been added to my subscriptions.
I love this mist.  The smell isn't too overpowering, but if you're really sensitive to smells, this may not be for you.  I have dry, mature skin and this helps with hydration.  It doesn't make my face shiny.  It just helps it not look so dry and flat when I put on makeup.
Vi este producto y busqué y tiene muy buenas reseñas, a penas lo estoy utilizando y huele muy rico y se siente bien en la piel, te deja un glow en la piel que es 100/10
Love this product, have been using it for a while and stopped when I ran out, but needed to purshace again! Its lightweight and makes your skin look like glass skin, highly recommend if you have a simple skin care routine
Nunca imagine el cambio tan rápido de; mi de tono de piel, como esta más brillante y más hidratada. Excelente producto.
I bought this, because it was a TikTok recommendation and it did not disappoint. My skin loves it. I use it as my first step in my skincare routine and sometimes my last step.I like the scent, it's very elegant. It absorbed nicely into my skin and helps prep my skin for the next step of my skincare routine.
I’m on my third bottle of this stuff! The smell is great and it makes my skin feel hydrated after using. Will continue to buy!
Trust me, BUY IT!!! So amazing. I use it before applying makeup and after to set it. Reduces appearance of fine lines and smells so good! Also evens out skin . Make sure you shake it before you use it every time
I’ve been testing out facial sprays and this one has been the most moisturizing by far. It sprays on easily and a little goes a long way. Not only is it refreshing, but it absorbs really well and leaves your skin feeling plump. It has some weight to it so it actually feels like you’re using a product that is doing its job. But not so heavy it feels greasy or like a layer of cream on your face.
Deja la piel reluciente y glowy!!! Este no será el último. Desde ya forma parte de mi rutina de skin care. Lo uso antes del maquillaje y antes de dormir como parte de mi rutina.
This is the best serum spray! I use it twice a day. Once to set my makeup and in the afternoon for a touch up.  When its on sale, I buy at least 2 of these!!  A must have to keep your makeup looking fresh and a classy finish.
Me encanta te pongas maquillaje o solo en tu cara con tus cremas queda bello
This product is great. It’s super hydrating and it makes you look so glowy. It makes you look like you have natural glass skin. It’s also super lightweight and very hydrating.
Cumple las espectativas iniciales, se vera a lrgo plazo
Aunque no lo he usado por mucho tiempo siento que si funciona bien humecta la piel deja una sensación de humectación, y de una piel más viva, me ha gustado mucho.
Me encanta cero grasa y la piel lindisima
I mean, I use it as a primer, i love the glowing thar leaves on my face and neck. healthy look, convenient bottle, pricing/ quality nice. I would buy it again no doubt.
I am so glad I bought this the results are nothing short of a miracle. I keep mine in the fridge and it just elevates the cool mist . The texture od the sking is so good!
Es un glow radiante, todas lo deberíamos comprar 🫶🏻
This has to be the best face spray I have ever used. Love..love..love it.  Subtle glow is perfect.
My skin is beautiful
Muy bueno, lo recomiendo..gracias
Very light texture, medium size bottle. Easy to use sprays very soft. Leaves the skin looking dewy and glowing. Very light product. A slight scent. I’m really liking how my skin looks and feels. You do need to shake the product before use. It’s vegan so really seems to be of good quality and really does wonders for your skin. This will definitely be a product on my regular shopping list. I have yet to see how it will work with my makeup on.
Es muy producto q deja la piel con un brillo espectacular y el.maquillsje dura por más tiempo.
Delightful treat for your face, keep it in the fridge… feels so nice straight from the fridge.
Es muy refrescante, si da un brillo bonito
Great product
It has evened my skin texture. Very effective. Absorbs quickly. Gives a beautiful glow to my skin. And it's light. You can add more skincare on top of it.
This serum has helped a lot to mi wife.
Queda suave la piel, quiero ver ya los resultados finales por su uso
This product feels very good on my skin I have noticed a change in the appearance of my skin it looks a little tighter and feels that way too smoother and a little more radiant I will order this product again
Aplus
This face mist is so light and smells amazing. I keep mine in the refrigerator and it is so refreshing. JUNGKOOK of BTS uses this and I just had to have it. It’s the best face mist I’ve ever tried. Highly recommend it.
It feels amazing - so nourishing to my skin. I can’t stop spraying it all day :)
I use this before my moisturizers or after makeup it leaves me looking dewy and glowy
Excellent product
Su aroma y su textura perfecta y mi piel muy hidratada todas las mañanas .
Bought this for my face because I have been swimming several times a week this summer and didn’t want to use anything with alcohol based products. So many products contain a substantial amount of alcohol in the first few ingredients. I tried it as soon as it arrived and have been using it every night before bedtime. Leaves my face feeling moisturized and so smooth. Lightweight and really easy to apply in about 4 spritzes, my face feels and looks great. Try it and I’m sure you’re going to love it.
I don’t know if it’s just the illusion of having moisturized and healthy skin and I don’t care because dang, it really works! Smells nice too. I’ll be using this every morning for the rest of eternity. They don’t sell it at Sephora so I’m guessing this is a best kept secret.
I travel a lot, and I love spraying this on my face throughout the day. It gives you a glowing look, and keeps you face looking hydrated.
Another Korean skincare product that is so soothing to the skin. I have put this on subscription. I really feel how moisturizing this is
La bruma huele bien; hace su cometido! Pero siento no es imprescindible en la rutina aún no se, si lo volvería a comprar!
Te deja la piel sedosa!!!
Gave me a beautiful glow
Muy buen producto y me hace un glow espectacular 😍😍😍😍😍
I don't know if this does anything to my face I'm 70. What much can it do but I love how it feels. It is cooling. It gives my face a glow.I just love it I will continue to buy it.
I love. how this product works in my sensitive skin, I recommend this product!
Me encanta no es pegajoso y si se nota la diferencia mi cutis estás espectacular los cambios se notan lo recomiendo
It worth it to purchase during sale. Smells nice. Light and moitsuri. Sometimes feels a little bit sticky on the skin.
Me gusto que deja un glow increíble
i use this all time time even setting my make up
Truly an awesome product! I use this with my rosewater and glycerin spray as well and my face just looks so hydrated and dewy.
This spray works amazing on my face! Love the after glow it has!!
I use this right after washing my face, before applying actives and moisturizer. It feels great and has the perfect mist. I highly recommend.
The first day I used it I could tell this will stay in my skincare routine.Slight but fresh fragrance that diapears.  Love this!
I like this, it’s an easy spray that has genuinely helped with getting rid of pimples and zits for sure! It does help with those black heads that are raised on the skin as well! The smell is really nice too, reminds me of just a clean and fresh smell, definitely buying again!
It leaves my skin beautiful, illuminated and radiant.
Huele delicioso y deja la piel perfecta
Great spray toner
It is very hydrating and it makes my skin glow.Pros.1. Hydrating2. Gives a healthy glow3. Nice scentCons.1. Oil separates2. Use up quickly
This stuff is amazing! I have skin that can get oily easy and very dry easy as well. This product is light and hydrating but not oily to break my skin out (which normally products do). I truly will buy this again and love the way it makes my skin look after using.
Makes my skin soft hydrated and glowy. Will definitely make mention of this in my upcoming YouTube channel and social media platforms
The media could not be loaded.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I am absolutely in love with the d'Alba Piedmont Italian White Truffle First Spray Serum! This product has been a game-changer for my skincare routine. From the very first use, I noticed a significant difference in the hydration and glow of my skin. The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy residue.I have sensitive skin and was worried about trying a new product, but this serum is non-comedogenic and vegan, which made me feel confident about using it. The scent is subtle and luxurious, and the spray application is so convenient—perfect for a quick refresh during the day.After consistent use for a few weeks, my skin looks more radiant and feels incredibly soft. It has also helped to even out my skin tone and reduce the appearance of fine lines. I love that it's an all-in-one mist, saving me time and simplifying my skincare routine.Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high-quality, effective serum. It's worth every penny!
I have dry/normal skin but it gets clogged easily and I can break out when the product is too strong or heavy, but this. I put this spray on as a part of my skin care routine and i’m moisturized for 24 hours i tell you. I kinda douse my face in this too😋 Well I haven’t been leaving the house recently cuz i’m on winter break but from what I can tell this thing lasts on my face for ages. And aside from that, the glow LASTS😟 (like, after using it for two days, even if I don’t just newly spray the product on, I’m still glowing like mad) and my pores? GONE. My whiteheads are dissapearing too??? I don’t know what this company put in this thing but I haven’t broken out, i’m glowing even without it, and my complexion just got so much more even and more vibrant. Idk what that white truffle does but all ik is that I’d eat it bc I love mushrooms.But anyways, I bought it twice bc it was on sale and it’s the greatest product I’ve ever bought. It smells and looks expensive but it’s not all for show. You don’t need that dior tatcha chanel whatever kinda luxury brands. D’alba, although i’ve never heard of it before, is my new favorite brand.I was rlly looking for a new serum since I just started this whole korean skin care thing and I didn’t have one, but all the other ones on here just looked kinda boring/not effective according to the reviews or were too expensive. While you can, and if you have a similar skin type to mine, you should get it while it’s on sale.
Muy bueno
Absorbs into the skin nicely. Not heavy on skin.
Love that the product is delivered through a pump spray.  So easy to use.  Great to use before applying moisturizer to lock in moisture to the skin.
The quality of the packaging is absolutely amazing. The feel is heavy, luxury, and it feels good on my face. The weight is nice in your hand. And ease of use is absolutely amazing as well, you don't have to fight to get it to spray.
This spray serum is the best! I love it it’s the perfect amount of serum and hydration.
Love it!!  It hydrate me the whole day without feeling greasy and it smell do good!
me encanta este producto se me acaba y lo vuelvo a comprar
Fantastic!
Smells beautiful, feels beautiful and refreshing, looks beautiful!! High quality product.
Me encanto! Siento la piel super hidratada😍
I love this spray! I’m a guy that requires a bit of extra moisturizing on my face, so I spray a few spritz after applying my facial cream, it makes a nice natural looking sheen and I love it! Plus the smell is not too strong or girly. Highly recommend.
Me lo pongo después de lavar la cara y me deja bien fresca.
This was a pleasant surprise, especially used in conjunction with the serum and dual cream. It keeps my face feeling supple throughout the day and given me more 'good skin days' to go foundation-free. Will definitely repurchase.
I experienced a noticeable difference using this regularly on my skin.  I will continue to purchase this. It's not oily or greasy. It feels nourishing and light.
Doesn’t have odor it’s fabulous, leave your skins glowing! I love it. I’m going to order again.
No dislikes at all!!!
Me encantó el producto no esperaba menos tiene un olor exquisito y no se siente pesado en el rostro me gustó mucho sin duda lo compraría de nuevo
I bought this after I saw a Korean mom and daughter speak about it on TikTok. Needless to say I’m obsessed. It has made my skin look glowy and healthy, it also has a really nice smell to it, it calms me.
This was recommended by “ PAINTED BY SPENCER” on YOU TUBE.  I love watching his makeup tutorials.I have oily skin.  I shake the bottle and spray it as a setting spray.  Makeup stays on all day.  Love it does not make my face oily gives a nice subtle glow - I feel it’s just the right amount glow.  Does not make me break out.
Deja un rico aroma y hidrata
It’s work very well I recommend it 🥰🥰🥰🥰 great product
This really melts your makeup together as setting spray but leaves you face looking flawless and dewy not in a sweaty way. I also apply before makeup and it’s hydrating to the skin. It’s worth it. I don’t regret the impulse purchase
I was not expecting to like this product as much as I do. The mist is fine, not overly wet or greasy. Smells nice and perfumy. Good size, great value
