Review
"Edit 2/13/24: After two weeks of use, I wanted to update my review. I did find that if I use this too much or too often it will start irritating my skin a little bit (as in I get minor breakouts). I am more acne prone, and do tend to break out slightly when using anything with niacinamide in them or even certain facial oils, but not too much. The effects of this spray is still really great in terms of hydrating and making skin look more plump and glowy. So I've found ways to work this into my routine that I found works for me:-using only *one* spray on each side of the face-not using this as my very first step, but after a hydrating serum to give it a little buffer-using this only 2-3x a week spaced out - as another reviewer here said, the glow does seem to last longer than a day even after I wash my face, so I use that to my advantage and space out my usage. if I see the glow fading (usually after two or three days for me) or I look particularly dry, I spray upAll in all, I like the effects of this serum. While I don't know if I can use it everyday I will continue to find ways to use it, especially since it looks awesome as a setting spray after makeup - really smooths and softens everything out while giving a nice dewy glow.I did change my review from the original 5 to 4 stars for minor irritation factor.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, so wow. I did have high hopes for this spray, and so far, it does not disappoint. I sprayed it on half my face as a first step after cleansing this morning, and I must say, the side that I sprayed, my face is way more plump, supple, glowy and vibrant, and because of this, even looks more youthful. The sprayed side is definitely hydrated in the way that it looks *and* feels. Yes, I can even move my face more freely because it's so well-hydrated as opposed to the side that I didn't spray. The non-sprayed side is definitely more drier from my mineral sunscreen and I can feel the dryness when I move my face and talk. I have dry to combo sensitive skin, and this has not irritated my skin thus far. I was more than anything wondering if it would clog pores but I think the niacinamide works well with the oils so that that doesn't happen. Something about the way this is formulated, it's well-put together so everything works really well for the intended effect. One thing I will say - it does have a strong smell. When I first sprayed it I thought it smelled so strong, but so familiar. And then I realized, ""So this is what I must've been smelling on those flights to Korea."" I vaguely remember on my trips to Korea, the planes having a faint wisp of this scent. It really just reminds me of Korea when I visited, and now I know why. A lot of people probably were using this spray and for good reason. And, for the amazing effect, I'm willing to live with the fragrance. Overall, loving this spray."
Wanted to love this product. Been researching more on Korean skincare and this came up and has high ratings however I used for about two weeks before and after applying my makeup. Now I‚Äôm a dry face girly and I saw this product on a YouTube ‚Äúproducts for dry skin‚Äù it smells amazing!!! I wanted to love it but it did not moisturize or leave my skin dewy or feeling refreshed. I unfortunately would not recommend for dry skin or if you think this is going to be ‚Äúglass‚Äù skin like
Para mi buen producto lo comprar√≠a nuevamente
I recently tried d'Alba Italian White Truffle First Spray Serum, and while I appreciate its luxurious feel and the hype surrounding it, I found it to be less hydrating than I expected. The serum has a pleasant scent and a refreshing mist that feels nice on the skin. However, I was hoping for more intense hydration, especially given its reputation among flight attendants. It‚Äôs a good product, but if you need deep moisture, you might need to layer it with other products.
Love this product very moisturizing light, use it more than once a day..  on autoship and I am fussy!!
El producto es bueno pero esperaba tener una sensacion de mayor hidratacion. Buena opcion precio calidad.
I only knew about this bc of BTS. Having been curious, I found it here and I like how it feels and the quality is good and smells great.  The ease of use fits into my skin care routine.  Having said (written) that I hope this product is not sold out.
The spray bottle is excellent in producing fine mist. I used it only once. My skin felt pretty smooth after it dried out. But I had to give it away since the fragrance is quite strong and started to give me a headache. Such a pity--it is probably a great product for people who don't mind the fragrance.
Lo he utilizado 4 veces y no veo un efecto glow como el que ofrecen e RRSS. Quiz√° a largo plazo funcione muy bien. Huele bien, no espectacular
Very good product
It keeps my skin nice and glossy but it gives me acne
Love this serum mist!! The hype is real. I love how it smells like expensive skincare. Not a strong scent though. Very fine mist and leaves your face nice and glowy, especially for dry skin like me I love this! Will be repurchasing
it‚Äôs smell good but not over power, my skin doesn‚Äôt react to the smell. it doesn‚Äôt really do what it said, I barely see any hydration. 7/10.
It‚Äôs quite expensive for refreshing spray but fortunately, it‚Äôs more than that. I use it before and after make up for moisture and glowy
I bought this product ans it keeps my face smooth. The smell it is a bit strong but not much I usually put a towel so I don't get itvon my clothes when I spray it.
I like it so much I bought it in a travel size too, so I don‚Äôt have to be without it! It makes my skin feel more moisturized, and I like the experience of a spray in the summertime, it‚Äôs cooling and lightweight. The sprayer is a fine mist too.
Ami  NO me gust√≥
Creo que me deja la piel m√°s grasosa que lo normal pero en general soy de piel grasa
Smell fresh. I spray on last after I put my powder & blush to eliminate dryness from cosmetic powder. It gives a smooth dewy look. Doesn't feel greasy, it gives a light dewy shine w light spritz.
This is a lovely hydrating mist/serum. It's fantastic for mature skin and if you can get it on sale go for it! My only issue is that it is scented, I have sensitive rosacea skin so I prefer a fragrance free product for my face. If you don't mind fragrance on your face, treat yourself.
Well, in the last few days I have seen some results, I recommend it to
First noticed that the scent was very strong but I think I'm getting used to it.  My bottle had very little oil at the top compared to the ones advertised.  The oil was what was important to me, that's why I bought it in the first place.  I wanted that shiny glow look.  It took almost two weeks to get probably because it was at a special price.  Will update my review after I've used it for a week or two.  I want to give it a fair rating after that.
It makes your makeup look amazing. However, I have somewhat sensitive skin, and I found that it causes breakouts.
Help moisturizing the skin before makeup
Eh its alright it works well to melt makeup into ur skin but its not like the best thing in the world. kinda mid, but does make u glowy for a little bit
I‚Äôm very cautious about what I use on my skin, because it is prone to acting up. I‚Äôve been using this for about a week or two now and I think it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôs not causing any issues - or is doing more good than bad. I use it before applying makeup, and after I wash my face. It feels and looks luxurious, and I want to say it‚Äôs helped to clear my face up. Only time will tell! Will update review to 5 stars if all continues well.
Product gives the perfect glow!
I like spraying it right after my toner or if I don‚Äôt have a toner next to me that‚Äôs the first thing I put. I like the feel of it. It‚Äôs light weight and moisture my face right away. I have a combo skin and I still have to put a cr√®me on after this spray but overall, I like the feel of it.
I like it alot im just not seeing results. Feels super luxury but still TBD if I would repurchase it
Love this serum as a daily go to for my skincare routine. Nothing super special besides it hydrates beautifully. Gets the job done without causing breakouts.
My wife has very sensitive skin and is able to use it without a problem. If my wife likes it then I like it. Worth the cost. Will purchase again.
Love the spray serum, smells good tooüëç
This is my second tone purchasing this item , love how it gives me a glow
Nice scent ,nice mist not irritating
I have to say I do like the truffle spray , it leaves your face feeling soft and refreshed, with a hint of a glow. I will say is I didn‚Äôt like after I fixed my hair then used the spray,it sprayed on my hair as well making it unmanageable to work with it was to soft after that. So the next time I used it, I put a head band on, so it didn‚Äôt spray into my hair. Other than that little issue , I love it !
I didn‚Äôt notice much of a glow in my skin after using this product, as was promised. I did notice my skin softer to the touch and the texture seemed to even out, but I do use a few other skin care products so it could be from those. If you are expecting drastic results in a few days, you will be disappointed. Giving it a generous 4 stars because I don‚Äôt hate it. Probably would buy again. Smells kind of weird but doesn‚Äôt linger after absorbing.
Very nice scent but it looked like it was partially used? Like it wasn‚Äôt filled to the top, it looked like it had been used ?
This spray is like silk. It feels great on the skin. It has a rose scent. I am on the fence if it‚Äôs a purchase more than once product- but I do like it.
I use this when I need a great refresher I am trying different products at the moment it works well but I‚Äôm not going to determine this as great.
Tiene un aroma delicioso y me gusta los resultados
first time using it, I liked it, don't know if I would repurchase just because it's nothing special but I did like it
I have two bottles. My skin feels dry during winter, but during warmer weather, it works much better.
This product is wonderful at giving a quick boost of hydration, moisture, and GLOW. You can put this on right after cleansing, in between skincare steps, or even as a finishing spray for makeup to add extra glow.Make sure to shake before use as it‚Äôs a biphase formula. The sprayer itself is nice and dispersed the mist evenly and lightly, no random splotches of product shooting into your eye or anything like that. The scent is kind of floral-like, it‚Äôs not super strong but if you dislike fragrance maybe avoid this one.Overall not a must buy, but a nice to have if you‚Äôre looking for a quick hydration / glow, especially with makeup. Otherwise this doesn‚Äôt do anything that a hydrating toner/essence, or dewy setting spray wouldn‚Äôt do. Id recommend buying this on sale, personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the full price!
I love anything in a mist pretty much. This was super easy to use. My skin felt super hydrated.
My skin feels so hydrated and looks glowy after spraying this on my face. I love using it on every step of my skincare and makeup routine because the result is so much better!One thing i was a little concerned about is the directions say that it's recommended not to breathe it in. I'm only concerned in the fact that it might* have ingredients that may not be so good for us but that will require more research.Other than that, really love this spray, and it does what it claims.
Slight oil to nicely moisturize with other serums. The aroma is slightly too strong,  but it evaporates immediately.
Pens√© que daba m√°s brillo en la piel no me gusta mucho no se nota como vi en anuncios no lo volver√© a comprar
An extra glowing product for make up
I‚Äôm not sure if I purchased the wrong thing but I don‚Äôt see a lot of yellow stuff at the top of my bottle.
I love the smell and it give you glow, this is my skin after I woke up but I've been using it for a month now. I don't know if it does something on my skin though. It's nice as a make up prep spray. Your foundation will blend well on skin and reduce cakeyness.
I definitely got swayed by the raving reviews. Looks nice on the skin for a few minutes but then it makes no noticeable difference. Instead, my skin seems to react negatively to it, possibly due to the fragrance. It feels like only half of what sprays out actually lands on the skin and then instead of sinking in, the oils just sits there and the rest evaporates. It‚Äôs a bummer because it was a splurge item for me and it disappoints every time I use it.Edit: I was able to give to someone who loves it! This brand also has excellent customer service.
Not sure if it benefits my skin much yet but I will say it‚Äôs refreshing , has a light scent and is satisfying to spray on
Leaves my skin glowing, feels a slight bit sticky after but nothing overbearing or gross feeling.
Hidrata con un brillo y un aroma √∫nicos. Es genial, la volver√≠a a comprar
A nice light mist that seems to provide enough moisture without being overly greasy. Would buy it again.
Work great but the scents are a little strong for me but it go away after a while after I spray it on
Tu piel cambia , a mejor , y dura el dia completo no se retira ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I was looking forward to more ""glow"", but it suffices. It's a notch up from the rose water I've used."
Just ordered 2nd bottle. Got recommended by cousin and bought to try. It smells nice and absorbed very quickly. Just have to close eyes while spraying otherwise it stings pretty badly.
I use this serum before make up like toner and after make up like setting spray. It make my face shiny and more moisture. I voted 4 star, because 2 or 3 days first, I have a little irritation, it isn‚Äôt burning, just itchy some spots. It look good now.
The reviews on this would make one think that it‚Äôs some sort of miracle spray. It‚Äôs not. I mean, it‚Äôs fine but I prefer my stuff from The Ordinary way better. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again but it‚Äôs ok!!
Para darle luminosidad a la cara
It‚Äôs a good and pleasant product. Is it going to transform your skin? No. I use it instead of a toner or essence. Smells amazing though
The media could not be loaded.Nice glow, great sprayer, but you can feel it on the skin. Not greasy at all, sticky yes!Leaves a film, not hydrating but glowy.
It leaves the skin with an amazing idol-like glow but the smell although is nice it‚Äôs pretty strong. I haven‚Äôt feel or notice any skincare benefit from it. It‚Äôs a nice finish product if you‚Äôre willing to spend, but totally unnecessary.
This product gives a real pretty glow. I spray before bed and it last all night.
Works good.
Moisturize my skin! Love it!
I love this serum. Just wish it sprayed more like a gentle mist, instead my nozzle spits the serum at me. lol.
This product will make your skin glow and will make your face looks fresh.
I like the serum it does give me a glow. On my second bottle
The media could not be loaded.Only thing is you need to shake it because the ingredients separate when not used. Did not irritate my skin and felt hydrated
I tried out this serum for the first time over my foundation-it wasn‚Äôt sticky or heavy at all and felt very cool against my skin! It settled nicely into my skin, felt very hydrating and gave me a little extra glow!
it has a nice smell and does feel pretty moisturizing but yeah idk its cute or whatever
The media could not be loaded.Didn‚Äôt like the appeal of oil seats on top
Definitely hydrating. I took off 1 star as I found the scent pretty strong. Looking forward to seeing the long term results. Already recommended to one friend.
good
I love how convenient this product.Gives me instant glow and hydrates my skin. I thought its gonna have like a truffle smell but I‚Äôm surprised it has a great mild scent. I also like that is a mist spray.
I love this product and it made my skin radiant and shiny. However the scent is very strong and make me headache. Is there a same product but without any scent? Thanks
This was really hydrating. I thought it was going to be more oily but I was pleasantly surprised. It‚Äôs very lightweight. I felt fine using it during the summer months and under makeup. I use this all day!
Firstly I loved the smell of the mist, it can‚Äôt completely moisturise the skin but works well under your moisturiser.
Hydrating!!!  Feels good on the skin and makes you glowy!!
Makes my skin very glowy!But the smell is the only thing that‚Äôs making me not want to use it‚Ä¶I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to scent and was hoping the smell will go away overtime but it stay for a while.
Thank you it‚Äôs very nice.
It took a while then my husband said you smell like roses
I like this product bc luminate and glows skin. But, not to much hydration for mature skin.
Light and refreshing
d'Alba is good not as excellent as it was made out to be but good none the less.
I was presenting the incorrect information!  It was not this bottle!  Love it‚Ä¶ my apologies!
"It smells nicely. It gives some very light moisture on my skin. But I am not sure what benefit this product has really. Most of the times my skin gets those small red speckles, like irritation after every use. So instead I've been using it as a body spray once in a while, as it does smells nice and refreshing.Because the ""oil"" or whatever yellow substance is, separates from the white transparent liquid, you have to shake it well before using it.I do like how this serum gave my skin a nice burst of moisture without feeling greasy or heavy. It is lightweight, and I make sure the mist distributes throughout my face so I'm sure to not miss a spot. I use this when I'm at home and spraying this on my face, several times throughout the day as needed.The only thing that must be causing an allergy on my face is that it has added scent and my skin is quiet sensitive lately to everything that has perfume or scents.I'd recommend it. Yes. You'll enjoy it"
Me encant√≥ el producto porque deja glow en el rostro pero no te go muy claro si usarlo luego del skin care y luego del maquillaje o antes. Si alguien sabe ‚ù§Ô∏è
The media could not be loaded.Si te gusta bastante el glow, es el adecuado, para mi me deja muy brillante, sella el maquillaje sin estropearlo. Recomendado
I like the convenience of a spray serum, and it does what it says to add glow. I used it o er make up as a setting spray snd to lessen the look of my powder. It is impossible to keep froSpraying on your lips, and it tastes gross like licking a bar of soap.
I honestly like it. But it‚Äôs false advertisement. Says made in Italy. Then on the back everything is in Chinese writing and says made in China. So who even knows what ingredients are in this
Thanks üôè
If you‚Äôre looking for a lightweight mist/primer, this will be for you. The scent is not overwelming. Not greasy at all.
I like the glow it gives your face. Very light but refreshing and hydrating.
Great product!
I feel like this product is just okay. I wouldnt buy this for the full 35 dollars, i feel like thats not worth it. I bought it when it was 50% off btw. The scent is okay but im usuallt not into fragrance in skincare
EDIT: The company contacted me after seeing my 3-star review and offered a refund cause I wasn‚Äôt satisfied. Adding an extra star for great customer service.REVIEW: .Since I got into Korean skincare I was curious about this highly recommended mist. I finally decided to spend the money and see what‚Äôs it‚Äôs all about. Waited until fall when my skin started getting a bit dry during the day, and tried this one instead of applying an additional layer of moisturizer in the afternoon  when needed. Well, it definitely adds a glow like it promises, but you have to spray more than suggested to achieve that moisturized level, at least for me. Plus the smell when sprayed  is  not pleasant, and keep your lips tightly closed cause the taste is awful as well. I used it 3-4 times and I can tell it won‚Äôt last long seeing how much I have to use in one go. So, once I finish, I‚Äôll go back to using a lotion during the day when skin feels dry. Maybe its main purpose is for the plane rides like it originally started in Korea, who knows. Overall, nice luxury product, but not really needed.
