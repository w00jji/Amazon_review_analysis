Review
NOT eczema prone/dry/sensitive skin.Casually using this for about a year and recently started incorporating it more into my skincare routine. I noticed the high points on my cheeks (my usual eczema flareups) becoming extremely dry. For months i’ve wondered how my skin could feel so hydrated yet have such dry parches. Tried everything - bought new moisturizers, cleansers, etc  It wasnt until i took this product out of my routine that i soon realized it to be the culprit of an eczema reaction. Within 24 hours the scaling skin on my face was gone. I will continue to this on my neck and chest as those areas seem to handle it well but definitely not for the face anymore which is unfortunate because it does give that “glow from within” without feeling greasy.  perhaps this may be best suited for those who lean more oily skin type.
I tried this spray several times and each time it felt like little sharp pins going into my skin.  I was very surprised as it did not hurt but it was unpleasant.  About 1/2 hour later I had a rash on my chest and neck. I had my daughter try this and she had not issues. Will be giving it to her.  I was really surprised about this because the reviews for this product are great! I downloaded the OnSkin app and the d'Alba Italian White Truffle First Spray Serum rates 59/100. For my skin it has a moderate chance of clogging my pores. There are 4 ingredients in this product that are known allergens: Hexyl cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, and Citronellol.  I must be allergic to one of these ingredients but needless to say, I was excited about this product because of all the rave reviews but I will not be purchasing this again.
This product burns! I shaked it before I used it and closed my eyes when spraying, but it still got into my eyes. That burns! And then I felt a little itchy on the cheek area, so I ended up returning it. I think it's way too harsh on my skin.
I love face mists so I decided to try this one out considering it’s a number one seller on Amazon and honestly I am just not really impressed with this product and it is not making it into my standard skincare rotation. I’ll admit it has a nice fine mist and I don’t think there is actually anything wrong with it, it just doesn’t compete against what I am already using or add anything to my skincare routine.I’ve ended up keeping it my gym bag, along with another serum mist, to be apart of my post workout skincare to hold me over from when I wash my face at the gym until I get home
Not sure about this. It's nice when I spray in on my face, feels goods, smells nice but, as soon as it dries I notice mlno difference. I'll keep using the bottle but I won't reorder. I need see improvements to keep buying stuff like this.
The spray is ok, but I didn’t really get what’s the hype. On my combination skin, it didn’t really make much difference. However it left an oily circle stain on my furniture so make sure to wipe the bottle after use.
Having been reviewed by an influencer that I respected I was eager to try this product. But I have to say that I wasn’t enamored by it. I found it performance to be flat. I don’t feel Compelled to buy it again
Si no te agradan los olores fuertes este producto no es para ti , tiene un olor a almizcle . Que no me agrada para nada.
No es tan brillante como lo describen , al ponérsela en el rostro no se ve tan tersa e iluminada
It came in a sealed bag and some of the contents had spilled out. What happened to quality control?I did get a new one today that was in a sealed box(as it should be). I have tried it once and really like it.I find it hard to believe that they would send out a used, unboxed item.I am giving it 3 stars because of the one that came first.As far as the product itself, seems like it will be good.
I wanted to wait to try this product- i was using it every day and whike its refreshing- It did nothing for my skin-  itst just 90% water with 10 % of the oils and other ingredients - I would not buy again. Not great quality
I wanted to rave about this, but I don't feel like I notice a big change, personally. I have been using for about a month. Also, it smells funny, so I always feel weird breathing it in, lol.
While it does have a great spray nozzle and makes my skin dewy, it has a VERY strong scent. I put it under my makeup and the smell lingered for about an hour later. I don’t feel like it did much to my skin and really just felt oily.Not my favorite product.
If that’s your goal: to look shiny. Otherwise rather gimmicky because it doesn’t truly moisturize. Maybe it helps some feel relaxed? The scent is rather strong.
This product has a pleasant scent and does give hydration and glow to your skin. However, when it dries the hydration feeling is gone. I still liked it for the most. If the hydration lasted longer, I would have given it five stars.
The fragrance is too strong for my liking so I have been unable to use it. :(
Pleasant smell, but not sure if it actually does much else. Will have to see in the winter.
If u like your face looking like oil and shiny all this this is for u.
Creo que 3 estrellas es mucho para este producto. Esperaba más por las reseñas
Patch tested on my arm & nothing happened but a slight bit of redness. Sprayed on my face & my skin became red & itchy within 10 minutes. Very similar to when I've used too much Niacinamide. (My sensitive skin does *not* love Niacinamide and it's in almost everything now). This product definitely has a high percentage of Niacinamide, unfortunately for me.The smell is nice but it's not my favorite. I did notice a nice glow. I think I'm going to have to experiment with how to make this spray work for me once my skin has calmed down. Hopefully I can keep the glow & lose the irritation.*UPDATE*Day after first use and my face is very itchy with little red splotches. It has to be the Niacinamide that's causing the reaction.*Update #2*I'm definitely experiencing full blown contact dermatitis on my face.
I bought this at the end of April, it is now the end of June. I use this spray daily. Honestly, I don’t see a difference in my skin. Additionally, the “glow” only last about 2 minutes after putting it on. I will go back to using Rare beauty 4-in-1 midst. The rare beauty midst keeps me glowing for hours. Additionally, it brightens up my skin. This product is not worth the money imo.
Didn’t notice any difference it made.
Not sure how to feel about this spray. I have used it for a month. Haven’t seen much of a change in skin. Dewy look and feel. I will keep trying to out and see the results later.
I have no idea where the hype came from in these reviews. It’s nothing special for the price. Not worth it.
Did'nt give glow as stated very disappointed we hope Amazon tries his products,used on face
I noticed no remarkable difference when I used this spray.  My face didn't look moisturized or glowy.I also noticed a very strong smell of perfume.  I don't use perfume on my face or scented ingredients.  To be honest, the smell was lovely and if they have an actual BODY spray, I'm in but not on my face, that's a no no in my book.  Item returned.  ☺
I bought because all of the hype around this product. At the end of the day its just a dewy setting mist. Made me look too dewy. I prefer the morphe spray or the mac fix plus.
I'm using Korean products for face washing and it's making a big difference. I'm always looking for other products to compliment my routine. This White Truffle spray had great reviews, but luckily I ordered the small size to try it out because it didn't do anything. I don't really like the fragrance-it does dissipate quickly though. It just didn't do anything for my complexion. You have to hold your breath when you spray it too. Big hype, but no results.
I am sure it's great but not for me as I am prone to allergic reactions. Smells good for what I noticed.
Meh! I have dry skin and I like this, but not sure I see any benefits from it. I dont look glowy or moisturized. I tried under-and over makeup, at night before bed etc. no real results especially for the price. I will finish, but not repurchase.
I read the good reviews and the bad reviews on this product. I sort of agree with both. This spray has a lovely fine mist that creates a lovely lasting glow on your face. However, if you get it on your lips, don’t lick them. Yucky taste!  The smell is light, not strong and overpowering as some reviews have stated. Here’s the reason for only 3 stars: This product claims to have healthy ingredients. I’m not sure I believe that. The word “vegan” means that there are no animal products used. However, there can still be whole lotta unhealthy things used! Any list with this many unfamiliar long worded ingredients is questionable in my opinion. So there you go.
This was recommended to me, I ordered the small and haven’t used it for very long. I thought it would feel more moisturizing than it does. I will continue to use it and see if it’s something I want to reorder.
The product does leave the skin looking a bit glossy but after a few days, I started noticing a few breakouts. I try not to spray too much on my face. You can sort of smell the alcohol which caused irritation to my eyes. So avoid spraying around the eye area!!!!!!!!  I was expecting a bit of a different texture. For the price, I’m just going to say it’s an okay product…
I’ve only used the product a couple times and it’s okay. I’ve purchased other mist that seem to do the same. The scent is pleasant so I like it, we’ll see if this is worth the money after more use but so far it’s okayMy complaint here is really on the seller since the box came taped so I’m suspicious of that gave me a returned bottle. I’m using it this weekend so i’m keeping the bottle but I don’t think I will be buying from this seller in the future. I’m just not confident i’m getting a new bottle.
This product is just okay does nothing
nothing special smells like Granda from the 70s
feels great on the face, leaves my skin soft and glow-y, but the fragrance is overpowering. headache inducing. and considering you’re meant to spritz it on your face… it just seems a little silly to add such a strong fragrance. even when i hold my breath for as long as i can, it still invades my nose and throat. if this came fragrance free it’d be pretty close to being a perfect product. as it is, i probably will not repurchase. which is a shame because i want to love it!
After using for some time, the smell is not to my liking. I cannot describe the smell, but wet wood.  I guess truffles are mushrooms.
I have been using this every day and I have noticed nothing. I might as well be spritzing water on my face. The packaging is nice and the sprayer nozzle is fine. It disperses a nice mist. I am guessing there is some oil in there because I see separation if I don't shake it. But there is no oily feeling on my face. I live in a desert climate so my skin always feels a little dry. Perhaps if I lived in a more humid place would I notice a difference.
Love the cooling affect and softness of my skin after use.
This product makes skin glow upon use and is okay as a setting spray. However the presence of the oil seems really counterintuitive for a setting spray and made my makeup separate.There are only a few active ingredients in the formula but it just seemed a bit gimmicky to me. The smoothing effect was nice but nothing to write home about.Not for me. But for others, it may work better.
No brilla como dicen, no se nota
I ran out of my tatcha and this was slightly cheaper and a MUA on YT recommended this so I was like why not try it. I was shocked by how big this product was but felt that I needed to spray quite a bit, so that is a con. I think it would apply really well under makeup or OVER makeup (not to use in place of setting spray please note) just as a final mist to refresh and give dewy vibes because as a dry skin girl matte is not for me, but oh give me dewy and glowy. When I first spritzed it on last night, I did feel my skin was initially irritated by it, but it quickly calmed there is no sign of irritation today or breakout and i have sensitive skin so if a product is going to break me out, I would likely know 12-24 hours later. I still do prefer my tatcha as holy grail, but I like this to mix it up it is ULTRA lightweight and to me it didn't really have a scent. I thought this was Italian product but it's Korean so if you are into K skin give this a try
I don't like the way that it is separated and I don't like once I got a hold of it and it was delivered that it said to not spray near eyes or nasal openings or whatever so how do you spray it on your face safely?
I sprayed it on my face and started seeing red itchy spots appear within the hour… love the fragrance but I guess that might be what’s irritating. Sensitive skin beware…
About half way through the bottle and I’m not sure if this adds anything to my overall radiance or skin health. Just ok
I'm not too keen on the smell says nor to inhale. That's kind of hard when your spraying on your face.  Not impressed
Easy to use, it does give your skin that glow but doesn’t last all day, smells nice
The one thing I did like about this serum was that it was a spray on serum but other than that it didn't moisturize my skin enough. I tried using more to see if that would make it better but it didn't. I have really dry skin and it just wasn't enough for my skin so I gave it to a friend. I haven't heard how she likes it.
Been using this for 2 weeks now and don’t see any difference on my face.
Now, I love me a good facial mist. This one claimed to give a super dewy, moisturizing look and feel and I didn’t really get that from this spray. It’s just okay. I love my Glow Recipe Watermelon spray mist. That one really does feel moisturizing. I also like the HudaBeauty coconut facial spray-that one feels nourishing to the skin as well.
It is hydrating but the fragrance is soooo strong and does not dissipate.
Not sure why I purchased this, I think I wanted something for after I applied as and washed my facemask. I didn't see anything negative or positive. I don't feel like it's something I really need so I myself won't be purchasing it.
This was more glowy than dewy. My face feels dry and glowy so I recommend this for oily or combo skin not for dry skin.Def not glass like skin not terrible but pretty mid
This product smells like a rich old lady. I wish they made one with no fragrance. Overall it does what it suppose to do for a reasonable price.
It’s okay. Made my makeup look thicker and cakey. I think it would work better with little to no makeup.
Why when I received my order was there no container, almost no oil layer, and look no lid?.
I do like it but I think I was expecting more. It does give a nice glow but it doesn’t last. I’ll finish my bottle but will probably not repurchase.You do need to shake to mix it.
Cumple su función, deja la piel luminosa pero el aroma se metió por mi nariz y es bastante fuerte el olor, solo por eso le doy 3 estrellas porque estoy acostumbrada a usar productos en mi rostro que no tengan olor. Es muy fuerte para mi
I’ve been using this product daily and my skin is flaking in some spots and has a burning/sensitive sensation when I rinse it and put other products on which didn’t have before.  I followed the instruction which was to spritz approx 5 times onto the skin.  The dewy finish doesn’t last long.
I’ve used this and I do like it but it’s not that special…will not repurchase unless it’s on sale!  But it’s smells so different…hard to explain.  Not horrible but not the best either.  LOL
Water and rose oil is similar
Honestly I was influenced to get this by all the youtubers I saw recommending it. It does not live up to the hype… the fragrance is too strong and not for everyone and its not as hydrating as advertised. Just get a serum.
I bought this product as a facial spritz for my trip out west where there is no humidity and I am a total priss when it comes to my comfort. It smelled nice to spritz everywhere except my face, which got into my mouth.  The idea was to spritz my face, lock it in with a moisturizer. I ended up using Evian spray which is only water and some fancy moisturizer to lock all that goodness in.
El producto no me agrado por que,cuando quiero aplicar el producto en mi piel almomento de esprayarlo se tira por otro lado,eso es lo único mala.
So far this product seems to work nicely. Does not do very much. Does give a nice glow tho. Wish it was more hydrating.
It’s okay to use but it wasn’t as much as moisturizer as I expected when I sprayed first thing after washing face.
I like the product but,I do not like the fragrance it smells like cheap perfume little old ladies douse themselves with.I do not wear cheap perfume. It will clash with my perfume.If the product is revised, I suggest fragrance free.Plus, fragrances are not healthy for our faces anyway.
I bought this because of all the influencers talking about it . But it Made my face break out
Doesnt give me the affect that I want, and it’s quite irritating on my sensitive skin. Not worth it. It gives me glowy skin for like 10 minutes and my skin dry again :D the review said it’s good for makeup so dont trust it if you heard about it from any influencers.
This has such strong perfume smell, I almost returned it. Holy moly if you’re sensitive to smell skip this one!!
I bought this product while it was on sale and, glad I didn't paid full price.There are far more products for $36.00 in the market better than this. To me was a spritz of water and oil.
Did not meet my expectation.  Dewy look last only when wet.
I was expecting more from the product, the advertising show better results
I think it is working, though I don’t see those shiny skin on my face… I’m still figuring out how to use it in the correct way, without damaging my skin or breath
The product is okay but I can't get past their heavy perfume smell.  It seems like a heavy cheap perfume that someone has been wearing all day long mix with sweat.
what you pay
Lo presence por Los Buenisimo commentaries, es my grasoso si pones mucho asi Que te recomindo Que uses poco hidrata y suaviza
This product did not give me moisture or glow. I shared it with a friend and the same thing,  no moisture, no glow. I shook the bottle and sprayed liberally, still nothing.
A bit pricey!
Thai products made my face bumpy and dry.  In the process of returning.  Nothing is wrong with the product, it clearly didn’t work for me.
I saw this on tiktok and got influenced I should’ve left it there street having a bad reaction to it I had to toss it. It didn’t work for me I have dry textured skin so just be careful
Product gives a nice glow; not really a moisturizer though
This moisture spritzer is refreshing, especially in Colorado's arid climate. The mist is very fine and refreshing on a hot summer day when skin screams for moisture.  I think I could easily refill the bottle with rosewater and another light oil.
I’ve been using it for about a month or so , I didn’t notice any changes in my skin. Not really worth buying.
I like it has a great smell. It seems to hydrate my skin pretty well.
I don’t understand all the hype about this mist. There is nothing special about this.
I bought two bottles and I'm very disappointed I received one used.  I didn't try it yet
This has 3 pore-clogging ingredients and is not acne safe.
It worked fine for a week but after two weeks it started irritating my skin . I have a clear skin and have no issues with skincare usually but this definitely broke me into pimples.
I noticed an increase in acne after use.
I expected a real glow with this and unfortunately it isn’t what I thought it would be and after it dries it is slightly sticky. Instructions are in Korean and when you use the QR code to get English instructions it doesn’t work.
it's a very hot item on tiktok, that why I gave it a try. I waited until fall when my skin getting started drying a little bit. It leaves the  skin glow but doesn't last too long and the smell is too strong, like perfume.After I used it for 1 weeks It gave me a bit whitehead acne on my forehead so I'm not recommending sensitive and oily skin. But I'll try one more time
Not for me. Allergic reaction to this product
This product has a delicate, luxurious smell which I absolutely love. Id wear n it as a perfume if they made one! However, it does not stand up to the claims of ultimate hydration. I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to break-outs. While it did provide a soothing comfort when applied, it lasted maybe an hour for me. (It did not break me out).
Good
It's not worth the hype.
スプレータイプの保湿力の高い化粧水が欲しくて購入しました。・粒子はそこまで細かくはありません。ミスト・・というまでは行かない感じです。・使い勝手はとても楽です。・保湿力は正直あまり感じませんでした。さっぱりタイプという感じです。春～夏頃にかけて使用し始めたので、乾燥は感じてませんが、保湿はいうほどじゃないように感じます。・香り　これが結構私は苦手でした。昔の化粧品の匂いに感じます。細かい部分で期待したほどでなかったところはありますが、総じてまぁ悪くないというかんじです。スプレーで楽ちんで、お肌もちゃんと潤います。
I'm combining this serum with other products from the Ordinary and I wouldn’t be able to say if it is better than a hyaluronic acid of O.
メイクの仕上げやリフレッシュしたいときに使っています！コンパクトなので旅行のときなどにも活躍しました！！
