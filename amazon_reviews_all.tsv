I use it and it shows your skin glow but your skin still dry. If you go to sleep which I did because I used after bathe at night. I woke up with all my pillow lines in my face. My face usually feels humectant, but this time feels dry even it look humectant but with line of expressions. I use it 3 more times, it smells pire chemicals. If you open your mouth to breath it taste like perfume or deodorant. I decided to return it qnd they send me another one. Of course I don’t want to look older so I returned both. The refund process takes ONE MONTH and Half, yes, 45 days plus with a note saying they will charge you according with the amount you used it or the condition of the return and add 7 more days foe your bank make available the money. Definitely I can tell they use cheap product and make an effort to look it nice. I returned to my Japanese skin care.	1
If you are someone who regularly purges when trying a new product, know that this product will cause a terrible purge. I used this multiple times a day for two days, and by the third day, my face was full of red acne, which was very painful. I discontinued use of this product and all of my acne went away. I would not recommend it if you have a similar oily skin type that is sensitive to new products. It was a good deal, though.	1
I tried so hard to like thus spray but unfortunately it irritated my forehead to the point that it was peeling. It also clogged my pores a lot and I broke out and I am not one to break out like that, never really have and I am almost 42 years old. I was convinced it was the spray because it was the only new thing on my face. Unfortunately I will not be purchasing this spray again.	1
This serum has artificial fragrance and therefore it is not suitable for sensitive or acne prone skin..the fragrance will disrupt your natural ph and skin barrier, so no matter how many good ingredients are in there,  it all goes down the drain once the fragrance is added.	1
First off I want to say I don’t have sensitive skin. This stuff burnt around my eyes so bad that they were swollen. It also has a very strong smell like an old grandma. I wouldn’t ever use this again.	1
I received the product and use it. It has a beautiful smell but it is not Dewey whatsoever. It is sticky and tacky and it leaves no glow. The only reason I purchased the product is because of the Beautiful Dewey glow that it says in the advertisement. It does not work that way, there  is no shine, no do, no glow. Just sticky skin. Do not recommend	1
Believed the hype and bought a bottle. Felt awful when reading the box that it’s “rigorously tested” for human skin which implies animal cruelty. No cruelty free badge on product. This is also VERY heavily perfumed/floral fragrance.	1
I was excited when the product arrived at my doorstep.  So I tried it on my wrist first in case the product would irritate my skin. It was a nice spray application and the texture felt silky, however.... the smell!  It is a cross between wet leaves and foot odor... This is definitely going back! I couldn't imagine misting my whole face with it!	1
Save your money, this spray/ serum is not worth the hype at all. It almost has a burning feeling on your face and leaves you sticky and tacky.	1
After reading great reviews and watching many videos on youtube I decided to give it a try. I must be allergic to any ingredient that it contains, almost my full face had an allergic reaction to it. It burned and even it still hurts after I stopped using it.	1
This smells so bad! It also does not moisturize at all. Didn’t do a thing for my face and I use it twice a day and have since I bought it. I truly can’t believe the scent of this stuff. It’s horrendous. Would never buy again.	1
I used six pumps and it still didn’t hydrate my skin.  Yes, it looks shiny at first but then it evaporates.  I’ve even tried reapplying it and my skin feels tight and dry within 15 minutes (just as if I sprayed plain water on it).Quite disappointed in the quality of this product.  Don’t waste your money.Checked on several of the 5 star reviews and they only reviewed this one product. Quite suspicious.	1
As soon  as  I spray my face with this product  started itching  and burning. This product is not  suitable for people with sensitive skin. You need to do test before you apply this product.	1
I broke out so badly with this product that I was shocked my face looked like I was going thru puberty. I threw it away.	1
No lo recomiendo para pieles sensibles me dio alergia de inmediato decepcionada por que tenía buenas expectativas del producto.	1
This spray has a very strong, cheap, dime store perfume scent. The odor upsets my stomach and gives me sneezing fits.As well, my face becomes bright red and irritated post spray. I look like I have a severe sunburn.I notice that my eyes become very dry after using this product. So much so that I require lubricating eye drops, which I rarely use.There's a metallic shimmer to this spray that concerns me. None of my skin care products include metals. So odd.If you do use this spray I would advise caution. This seems to be a very harsh product.	1
El suero me llegó  por la mitad del frasco y deteriorada la etiqueta	1
During the inital spray it appears it'll hydrate your skin. Within seconds it feels like you have used rubbing alcohol all over your face.	1
First of all the seller shipped item very fast and was in great condition so that should be known. The product itself however was awful though. Smell does NOT dissipate like others mentioned, it lingers on the skin so long and it’s not pleasant, its very strong and smells like a heavy older perfume. If you’re sensitive to smells please pass on this. I couldn’t get past it, smells synthetic with a mix of some type of essential oils. I’m glad I first tried it on my hand and didn’t spray on my face. Sadly, I can’t mention anything about the skincare benefits bc I couldn’t get past the smell. I will be returning.	1
This smells aweful. Like cheap old lady dime store perfume. Spraying it on your face means you keep smelling it. I tried it once and can't do it again. It DOES NOT smell nice and citrusy as described.	1
I wanted to love this like everyone else but I don’t. The scent is a very strong perfume-y chemical type scent first off, so if you’re sensitive to that don’t buy this! Also, I tried it as soon as I got it, excited about it, and shortly after spraying on my face I started experiencing a burning sensation. I wouldn’t say I have sensitive skin so I’m not sure what was happening with that. I washed it off shortly after feeling the burning and I’m hoping it doesn’t continue to affect my skin. I also felt a tightness like it was more drying than hydrating. Needless to say I’m returning the product.	1
The spray serum is not suitable to my skin type , and I had allergic signs after 2 days of using it.	1
I heard about how amazing this product is. The main issue is that it’s scented and the scent is of an old lady perfume. Which doesn’t dissipate! So, I am returning it. Too bad!	1
When I received the box it was already opened. The bottle was 25% used up.  Never ordered again.	1
I couldn’t try it because of ingredients	1
I thought this was a good product but after a few uses my eyes broke out in hives. I have pretty sensitive skin but I thought this would be fine. I guess not.	1
Me pareció una estafa.	1
The oil just sits on very top and perhaps it’s not the real thing	1
I liked the product BUT after almost a week and a half of having used it, the liquid became very ugly with an expired appearance with lumps but it had not expired yet. I don't know if that only happened to me but it's my experience with the product. For oily or combination skin I don't recommend it very much since it is more prone to acne.	1
deff not worth the price, product does nothing	1
Smells burns and does absolutely nothing	1
It’s like spraying water on your face with essential oils. No glow at all. Extremely disappointed. Would not recommend.	1
The product came with no box and no top cap. Just placed in the plastic bag. It looks like used. I dont want to try and I have to return it.	1
Not as expected	1
The box was torn open and the bottle had makeup stains on it. It had obviously been used by someone before it was sent to me.	1
I am not generally prone to acne, but I used this two times and my nose broke out horribly with little pimples and what almost look like blisters.  I wish it had worked for me, but it didn't	1
Burned when applying and broke out while drying out skin	1
I seen this on TikTok and I thought it would be good. I bought something else like this and the exact same thing happened burn your eyes burn your lips not worth it people.	1
Saw this on TikTok, selling the “glass skin” from using this product. Anything wet will look like “glass,” but pretty useless spplixation once it dries up . WASTE OF MONEY! TOO EXPENSIVE!!!	1
Not at all what picture shows!!!	1
The product did absolutely nothing to my face. The reviews and video is definitely misleading	1
Do nothing	1
I got two bottles but one of it was broken. I am not happy with it because I was expecting a new product not damaged one.	1
I didn’t like anything about this product, didn’t moisturizer one bit, if anything it dried my skin. No redness or itching though. Those videos showing the faces so wet, where did they get them! I rate a minus if I could.	1
If you want a product that will give you a quick glow this offers that however it doesn't last long. I will not purchase again.	1
Watched many videos and thought I picked a winner. Have been using for 5 days and haven’t noticed any difference at all. My forehead looks greasy not glowing. The rest of my face looks the same. Won’t be purchasing again. Bummer	1
I admit I got sucked into all the reviews. It gives a glowy look. But all accentuates wrinkles and pores. I'm thinking if your 20 and want a glowy look this would be good. But not at 40 looking g for moisture. Also I try and do fragrance free. This does have a fragrance it's ok. It burnedmy eyes even closing them so I tried to just spray in my hand which didn't work because it's not really an oil.	1
This product irritates my skin. Stinging feeling that doesn’t go away until you wash it off. There is a slight glow but you can get that same glow with a tinted SPF or highlighter. Nothing special. Definitely don’t think it is worth what it cost. Overrated in my opinion. Gave it one star because you do have a slight glow. Lastly, the scent… no good.	1
It doesn’t give that shine at all and it’s just dry	1
This product does not give your skin enough moisture. It's not ideal for mature skin. It does not have anti-aging properties. I have used many other serum/oils sprays that are much better than this.	1
The product is great, except for the fact that is heavily scented.  It smells lovely. However, I do not want the smell to consume my day. I wish the product was unscented.	1
Spray didn’t work out for me unfortunately. Broke out all over and caused redness and no shine. I don’t recommend	1
At best, this is a mediocre product. It left my skin tacky and didn’t provide any significant hydration. I am not a fan.I’ve mixed my own water/oil sprays, which have worked far better for me and are customized to my needs. But I thought I’d give this a try. I’m going to keep making my own hydrating sprays and return this one. It certainly wasn’t worth the discounted ($18) price tag.	1
The media could not be loaded.A quarter of the product is  spilled	1
Very watery don't buy!	1
Only reason I give 1 star it made my face itch so much and tasted so bad! Since it is a mist it is bound to get in your mouth. I can see it being a great item but just not for me.	1
After applying the product my faces is glossy because of the water in the product but as soon as the product absorbs my face feels dry. I was hoping this product was good but unfortunately I don’t recommended.	1
I do want to support small companies but  sometimes they think they’re so greater than famous existing companies and priced themselves too high. Like this company.. ugh… sadly, the mist is barely ok, mediocre at best. It does not do much on your skin. Plus it leaves sticky and oily residue on the skin. No thanks for the price and the quality!  Just gonna go back to USDA organic rose water which is less than half of this price and still organic and fresh!	1
No me gustó, desde que lo comence a usar me salio granos alrededor de todo el labio de abajo, no es lo que esperaba no lo recomiendo, no es nada grandioso como dicen ,no vale la pena	1
I bought this product because I saw a video that said it left the skin well moisturized and it a complete LIE. There’s just a speck of serum and the rest is liquid. Would not be surprised if it’s just water. NEVER AGAIN.	1
i bought this product 2 months ago for $18. and now they’re bumping up the price from $18 to $36??? pls, it’s not worth that much	1
Gave me a rash but I didn't think it gave me a glow	1
mal producto	1
I returned after I started noticing I was getting breakouts after spraying this. I have normal-dry skin and usually don’t have problems with face products.	1
I did not use it because the it had already been open.	1
The smell is terrible and gives me a bad head ache.	1
And on top of it, smells like bug spray 🙄	1
I was so excited about this product, I saw so many videos and reviews about it. First time using it and I had a burning sensation, I had an allergic reaction to it. I don’t have sensitive skin neither Im allergic to anything. I don’t know what happened but it burns and left some ugly texture on my face 😭😭😭😭😭BE CAREFUL!!!!	1
This products smells really strongly of artificial fragrance. It did make my skin feel good but the amount I had to put on my face to make it wet, also made me nauseous by the strong smell. It smells like a bathroom air freshener. It made my skin burn and I had to wash it off. Do not get this if you are sensitive to smell or have sensitive skin.	1
Smelled awful though, got headaches with this one too! Had to return!	1
Not a good product for me. It leaves your face like cardboard. Difficult to move and it doesn’t provide you any moisture to the contrary. I don’t recommend this product at all.	1
No vi ningún cambio en mi piel	1
I was not impressed by this spray serum. The first time I tried It, I felt my face with a burning sensation, and it had a strong fragrance that I didn't like.	1
Took this to my NYE party and it got passed around with a few people trying it and we all had the same reaction…. Did not hydrate the skin and the fragrance was way too strong and smells awful. Also gives a burning sensation when first applied.	1
"I bought the White Truffle Sheet masks and used ONE, which made my skin as dry as the desert.So, I applied this serum oil for moisture.It didn't work.The next day, I had a bad rash on my face.I might be allergic to ""white truffles"".My skin rash looks so bad, I'm too scared to use this oil again.Forget it."	1
I couldn’t even get past on capping the serum. I couldn’t put that anywhere near my body. Why have such a natural product and then stick some synthetic hormone disrupting smell in there? There are wonderful essential oils out there	1
No es un producto legítimo te queda la cara con una sensación pegajosa	1
I have an app that tells you if products are safe and this came up. How sad Amazon is calling something hazardous as an Amazon choice. I hope this helps people. It also burnt my face	1
I couldn’t wash this off fast enough and I’m even more eager to return it. It smells like old lady perfume and made me feel as if I haven’t washed my face in weeks. Very disappointed.	1
Leaves a god awful after film and makes hands turn orange	1
this was a scam in a bottle.  I returned this	1
The packaging inside is torn. I'm not sure if it's old	1
Cause white residual on my face which left me embrassed like I am having dry skin, there is a lot of products that can give you a shiny look without the residual white scabs!	1
Opened item sent. This is not brand new. Manufacture tape is torn and scotch taped over. Buyers beware.	1
Result we’re not as expected or as advertise.. to the contrary skin  had a dry sensation and started to peel..👎	1
Product came with packaging seal open. Had indications of being used previously. Very disappointed, was looking forward to this product.	1
This product is garbage. It’s water with oil. I saw it did nothing to my skin so I stopped using it and after a few days of sitting found it with a yellow layer on top and watery liquid in the bottom	1
Not what's it supported as advertised ❗😡	1
Reasons why is not a good product:1- The smell is so strong that cause me allergy.2- It feels greasy.3- Does not feel glow or anything similar.4- No accuracy on the reviews you see here.Waste of money.	1
Intense Synthetic Fragrance.  Will not be able to use, Please have an Unscented or Natural Essence.	1
I was so excited to try this spray after hearing such great things.The spray smells so bad, it's a very strong perfume scent... so strong you can taste it.I cannot get past the smell to know if it's good for the skin.Returning	1
It has ruined my skin completely. Do yourself a favor and throw it in a trash	1
It broke my face out	1
This is a waste of money. I fell for the social media ads. Don’t do it girl. It’s NOT worth the cheap price.	1
Don’t waste your money. Buy some rosehip oil. It does more with half the price tag	1
Exactly what the title says... Nothing.. no glow, no moisturizer, and most definitely doesn't keep my make-up looking fresh and good longer one my face	1
Product was delivered with no lid and no packaging. Product looks like someone used it up. I have to return it. Very Disappointed.	1
nothing was wrong when the product was delivered to me function wise. however, they changed their formula to be “vegan” and all i got now was an overpowering scent that had no moisture whatsoever. so sad bc the og formula was god tier and i looked like a glazed donut (which is what i was going for) for the longest…hopefully i can find a different spray that was just as good as the og	1
I bought this because it said it gives you a moist look I have been using it twice a day and I don't see or feel a difference  just glad I got it on sale	1
I bought this after watching Carly Bybel’s Clean Girl Makeup Tutorial and it’s nothing like she described. I tried it by itself, layered, after makeup, etc. and it basically does nothing. It smells really nice but that’s about it. Definitely not worth $30. I’ll stick to MAC Fix+.	1
I have dry skin and was looking for a moisturizing spray to use as something to freshen up and hydrate my skin throughout the day. While this is fairly moisturizing, it has a very strong perfume smell. I used it regardless, even though I don't really care for the smell, and it broke me out.I use heavy moisturizer every day and I'm not particularly acne prone but this stuff gives me automatic chin and cheek acne. I'll stick with more affordable rose water spray.Hard pass.	2
I first saw this product from a beauty influencer online who I trust (Tina Tanaka Harris), it’s clear how much she genuinely loves this product.I really wanted to love it because functionally it works exactly as I wanted it to, and the ingredient formulation is the best for any spray serum, BUT: it smells like you got sprayed in the face at the mall perfume counter. Like walking into a Macy’s while peeling an orange. If that’s your thing that’s great but I can’t deal with lingering strong perfumes. Another reviewer mentioned it smells like grandma perfume and I was hoping they were going to be wrong… but it’s exactly right. It smells exactly like a perfume my late grandma wore which is nostalgic but not something I can use unfortunately. It also doesn’t fade quickly and even if you wash it off soon after spraying it your skin will still smell like it.The smell alone is not a reason that Amazon will accept as a refund request so I suggest if you’re on the fence about not knowing if you’ll like the scent of this product, then don’t get it. It’s such as shame because if this brand made a version with no parfum added or fragrance free, it would sell very well. I would buy it in a heartbeat.But I assume most people attracted to this product are wanting the sensory experience of the perfume, so if that’s you, you will genuinely enjoy this product.	2
I wanted to like this product due to its hype but, I cannot get over the perfume smell it has. I’ve used it a handful of times but have since stopped and will probably never pick it up again. I don’t know how anyone puts up with the fragrance, and usually I am not one to care for skincare fragrances but this just smells like I’m spraying straight up fragrance/perfume on my face. The few times I did use this I didn’t notice a difference at all. I think there are WAYYYY better products out there with less fragrance or no fragrance that is more enjoyable to use. Save your money buy something else!	2
I really wanted to like this , great reviews. The smell was overwhelming!  imagine spraying perfume on my face . Couldn’t get rid of smell. Had to wash face again. Not sure if it’s hydrating couldn’t use.	2
While it has a lovely smell and applies beautifully, I noticed that it caused my face to  breakout. I've found that using it on arms works perfectly for me! Just not the best fit for my face so I probably won’t buy again.Also, make sure to shake before EVERY use.	2
The hydration level is good, although after a couple of weeks of continuous use, day and night, it started to irritate my skin. Could have been the fragrance idk.	2
This product is super popular right now and big named people are doing sponsorships so I really wanted to try and had high hopes. IMO it’s not worth the hype or price tag. $26 for some glowy skin is not the vibe for 2023/2024 at all. It tastes horrible! If you get it on your lips which you will everytime it literally tastes like nail polish remover. The smell I can get over but not the taste it’s gross. Furthermore I don’t even notice the product doing much. I used as a skincare step and setting spray like all the influencers say to and there was a slight glow to my skin but nothing you can’t achieve with a smaller price tag and it also broke out my forehead which was otherwise clear. I don’t know, I’m just not into it and think that being $26 it’s not worth the hype. To add, leaving my review I notice the price has changed and is now $18. That’s kinda unfair that a product would fluctuate in price constantly. I’d probably return it if it wasn’t such a hassle. Pretty bummed!	2
How dare you charge the same $ fior 1 ozAs the same as 6 oz.	2
To be honest, this is another product that is just hyped up by the influencers. We spend our hard earned money, while they make money pushing this mediocre product. I’m sorry, but nothing is special about this spray. I’m mad at myself because once I again I fell for another product that is recommended and it’s nothing great.	2
When I purchased this I was super excited about bringing another level of moisture to my morning routine. After the 1st use my skin felt itchy in a couple of spots. So I stopped. However,  keep in mind everyone's skin needs and issues are different. Just using it in my hands I could feel the difference the product brings to the skin. This product I feel would be great for younger skin20, 30 or 40 and can be introduced in a new routine. It's just not for me and my current facial needs.	2
A bunch of influencers were recommending this and really talking this up, I should have known better because almost every one of the videos were sponsored. This is highly fragranced and started to cause little irritation bumps on my skin. I do have very sensitive/dry skin and mild rosacea and this did not agree with my skin at all. I can see this really working for someone who isn’t as sensitive/dry as me. The whole experience of it is nice but unfortunately it just didn’t work for me.	2
I don't understand why this is popular. This is just the same as any other ones on the market, I can even get cheaper ones like La-Roche...	2
Smells good but did absolutely nothing for my skin.	2
I love this product 3rd time buying but I am not happy with the small bottle. Thought it was larger.	2
I got sucked in by utube. My skin has no glow. Still as dry as ever.	2
No me gustó como deja la piel, la deja con aspecto grasoso y muy brillante y adicional me generaba ardor en algunas zonas de mi cara, seguramente porque soy de piel sensible.	2
I truly don’t understand the hype. First, there’s A LOT of fragrance, it’s like a perfume. While it does visually glow my skin, it’s SO drying. I didn’t do enough research so I overlooked that it had hyaluronic acid (my mistake). HA is actually not good for your skin as it attracts water and pulls the moisture from your skin to the surface. I physically felt my skin start to dry out. The glow mostly comes from the oil diluted in the product. I think you can make something like this on your own without the added fragrance. Just add water mixed with some oil in a mister. Anyway, I really wanted to like it but it just didn’t give what it was advertised to do.	2
I hace acne prone skin and this broke me out	2
At first i thought i liked it. But then when you are using it as a setting spray, your face stays wet. Your hair will stick to your face, it just feels extremely uncomfortable. And i have very dry skin so i thought this was going to be a game changer. I think I’ve used too much now to return it. Idk if the pink bottle would be better or this is a flawed bottle but i won’t repurchase	2
Tal vez sea mi piel que e demasiado sensible pero este producto me irritó demasiado la piel de la cara no fue mi mejor experiencia usarla.	2
Not give a glow at all.The oil parts always stays on top. Mixture look weird. All instruction and evertything is in chinese. Not impressed at allI don't know if this is a cipy of the original one or this is it?	2
I wanted to like this product, but it broke me out. It smells good and makes the skin very shinny, but It gave me acne and clogged my pores a lot. I have combination skin and I would say my skin is very resilient. If you have very dry skin this may work for you, but it did nothing but smelled good and gave me acne.	2
Recommended by an influencerNothing special	2
I’m going to keep the spray to see if the hype is worth it, but honestly , the fragrance is like perfume and completely unnecessary, especially in something you spray on your face.  I’m curious to see if I’ll have a reaction because I have sensitive skin.  I don’t k ow why fragrance is put in any facial product …  I will not buy again for this reason	2
I wanted to love this stuff . Though this stuffed burn my face and irritated it so bad.  My face felt like I had stand in the sun all day . I couldnt wear makeup for about a week .	2
"I'm picky and this did not deliver. I have been looking for a replacement for Belif Aqua Bomb Mist which has been discontinued. I was hoping this would deliver moisture and that ""glow"". It did not. It's okay, but just ok."	2
No me resultó me salieron muchos granitos ☹️☹️	2
I apply I don’t see no difference	2
Does not work.  Returned	2
I wanted to love this so much because I loved the original version, and I love the idea that this is vegan — plus, this version was on Sale while the other was not!unfortunately, I’ve sprayed it on my face on three separate occasions, and every time it’s made me red & itchy, without any other benefits.I really wish I would’ve just ponied up the $ for the original version, because it’s much better.	2
I have clear blemish free skin and upon using this I broke out in whiteheads for 2-3 weeks.  Went away after I stopped using this spray.  This is definitely not good for skin as it clogs pores.  Rather than returning I now use it for my hair—-at best, it tames flyaways and static.m and smells kinda nice.  Not worth over 25 bucks for sure!  Buyers beware!	2
Tight fitting. Size runs small. Sizing is one position off. A 2X More like an extra large and an extra large is more like a large.	2
When I went to Korea, I got this serum as a gift from my friend and used it. I fell in love with it because the scent was so good.  I used a whole bottle. I ended up buying this product from Amazon. The scent is completely different. Has the scent changed? The one I received in korea had a flower scent, it smells like male cologne....	2
I was excited to try this. Under makeup, over makeup. After a good wash. Bottle is beautiful and cute packaging. Smell is terrible lol. I really did not see any change in my skin or makeup application. Feels good to put on (but water feels the same??). I returned it. Too much money to spend just to dampen my face.	2
Not worth the buy, I don’t like the way it dries down. It’s only a glowy look because it’s freshly sprayed but I wouldn’t say it adds any additional hydration you couldn’t get with a thermal spray for less.	2
Is smells like a men cologne, and it refreshes gibes the glow look but isnt hydrating ad ai thought	2
Nada del otro mundo para el precio	2
No hace ninguna diferencia en mi rostro, actúa igual que un agua de rosas!	2
When sprayed on face and neck it is a very fine and light mist. It is very pleasant and leaves your face feeling like xtra hydrated. I feel it has a long lasting effect that I really loved.My biggest issue with this product is the smell. I was really hoping to not have strong perfume smell, but it does. Some may like this, but I do not. It gives me a head ache and leads to me being unable to use the product at all. Very sad and I would buy again if the scent formula was changed.	2
I love the product. But I have a bad breakout . It’s been years since I have an acne  and when I used this serum I have a bad breakout.  Not good for me at all	2
I bought this because a YouTuber convinced me I needed it. It left my face oily and sticky.  I can’t imagine using this AFTER I put on makeup as a setting spray.  Bottom line, everybody’s face/skin is different, what works for you may not work for me.  This did not work for me at all! I have normal skin but if you have dry, really dry skin, maybe this is for you.	2
I tried this product after seeing so many reviews on it and was unpleasantly surprised at how despite after shaking it vigorously for at least a minute on separate occasions, it felt like water was being sprayed and it didn’t make my skin look any different - if anything my skin got red and irritated..	2
Did not see much improvement, and need like 12+ sprays to see any temporary dewy look.  There are other products out there that have been way more effective for me.	2
I am glad I tested it on my forearm first because the smell isn’t tolerable for me. I had to return it. There is “fragrance” listed in the ingredients. I think it smells like a deep musk perfume and reminds me of something my great aunt would wear. I wish they could make one that’s fragrance free!	2
I wanted to love this spray like so many others but the fragrance is unpleasant. It smells like after shave for old men.	2
Definitely not worth $35, it has avocado oil that clog pours. Smells refreshing and it’s a spray so you can easily use it to moisturize.	2
Entirely too fragrant! It lingers in the air and overwhelms the senses. A fragrance free version is badly needed.	2
Made me feel like a grease ball and I broke out so bad. Would be great for dry skin ONLY.	2
Don’t waste your money didn’t see any difference. Is like just wetting your face with water.	2
The face looks much the same as before the spray . The video of the advertising was very convenient.  But it's definitely not Like that	2
I have sensitive and acne prone skin. Made me look like I had beautiful glass skin but then started to feel a burning sensation and made my face red 😭 so sad bc would’ve been a great product	2
I use it for one day and had a whitehead the next day. Also the fragrance is not needed, in my opinion. It interferes with my fragrance. I think I will use the product for my hair instead.	2
This was recommended by an utube influencer.  I did not like it at all.  I kept trying and trying..I wanted to like it but it irritated my skin and dried it out..	2
I didn’t see any difference by using this product. Don’t waste your money, it’s not worth it	2
my skin feels dry after using this.Smells good tho.	2
This is another social media hype. It hasn’t done anything at all considering the claims. Would I ever buy this again? That would be a solid no.	2
Really wanted to like this but it made me break out..	2
Don’t see a change nor improvement. I would not buy it again.	2
I purchased the Vegan First Spray and it makes my skin look amazing and feels great on the skin. However, I just cannot continue to use it. The fragrance is so intense that it made me nauseated and triggered a migraine. I never get migraines. Very bummed because I love how it looks and feels.	2
Doesn’t last long glow effect	2
It was kinda sticky. Not suitable for mine	2
Broke out my post accutane skin, which is wild because products usually can’t get that typa reaction out of me anymore. Smells horrible, but just trying to use as a body serum to get through it.	2
Feels good no shine it doesnt last	2
Just a sticky, tacky spray that does nothing that I can tell.	2
The scent is too strong. Made me sick to smell it.	2
I normally have really clear skin and this made my face break out	2
It dies not do what they are saying it will no glow at all	2
I don’t feel like this is worth the money. I bought it when this influencer raved about it. I’ll finish it. It’s just okay. Not worth the money.	2
I didn't like this product after a few days of use, I got a rash on my face. I didn't use it for a few days and everything passed, but when I decided to use it again, I started to have a rash on my face again.	2
توقعت أنه سيجعل الوجه لامعا لكن للأسف ليس له أي تأثير	2
保湿に関しては気休め程度なので、期待しない方がいいです。匂いが強いので、あまり良い商品だとは思いませんでした。	2
"I was so excited and hopeful for this spray. I had heard so many good reviews about it. But after day one of using it, my whole face had tiny bumps, rashy, itchy and felt hot to touch. This spray is heavily perfumed so anyone with sensitive skin like me and many others, may be best to steer clear of it. I'm so disappointed that I spent so much on this and have to just chuck it. Stick to more gentle products and not ""trends"" such as these."	2
Lo llevo usando a diario en mi rutina, mañana y noche, desde que lo recibí hace cosa de un mes y no puedo decir nada especial de este.No noto mayor hidratación, la textura de la piel no cambia ni a mejor, ni a peor.Aporta cierta luminosidad pero no creo que sea algo especialmente reseñable.Por su precio creo que hay serums o cremas que aportan más.Lo seguiré usando pero no creo que repita.Es agradable en la textura y el fresco que aporta a la piel al pulverizarlo, pero no puedo destacar nada más.	2
Riecht gut sieht gut aus und man fühlt sich gut wenn man es aufsprüht aber tut nichts für meine Haut.  Würde ich niemandem empfehlen . Dann lieber hyaluron und ein Feuchtigkeitsspray drunter	2
前回購入した時の販売元は東京で、今回届いたものは大阪でした。今回の商品はスプレーの出方がまだらでおかしかったです。本物なのかどうか不安になりました、、	2
保湿感は出ます。気軽にお風呂上がりにスプレーできるのも良いです。探し求めてた商品なのに。臭い！臭すぎる！子供の頃嗅いで臭いなと思った母や祖母の化粧品、おじいちゃんの香水の匂い……効果云々より臭いが無理！使えない……でもそれ以外の使用感は今のとこいいので匂いがなんでもいい人にはおすすめです……	2
This product is really nice but expensive ordered it one day the next day half price same company tried to return it and order cheaper one but was not allowed	2
気に入っていて３回目のリピート購入でしたが、今回届いたスプレーはオイルが漏れていました。箱にまでシミがあり、本品のフタもオイルまみれ。気に入っていただけに、残念です。	2
I wanted to like this based on  reviews, but I had to return it.  It's VERY scented, not lightly scented and my skin hated it and had a reaction to it.  If you have very sensitive skin, think twice about using it.	2
Me decidí a comprarlo por las buenas reseñas q tenía y me ha decepcionado. Yo utilizo un maquillaje muy denso pero q no es malo(steel lauder doble wear) y aunque me encanta, apaga mucho la piel entoces pensé q este producto sería la solución pero no fue así. Es más, me deja la cara como a manchas, como si no hubiese extendido bien el maquillaje. Probé a echarlo antes de maquillarme pero como si no echase nada. Igual no causa efecto en todas las pieles. Yo reconozco q no pude conseguir el efecto q deseaba.	2
あまりにもInstagramでみかけるので、購入しましたが自分的には匂いが好きではないです。お祖母ちゃんとかを彷彿させる匂いに思えました。1度プッシュしたっきり　棚にしまいました。このまま捨てるんだろうなと思います。	2
バズってて買って使ってみようと思ったのですが使い始めてから約2ヶ月間効果がわからないですいい匂いですが使ったあと微妙にベタベタしますが肌に効果的ではないと思いますトリュフ入ってるのは確かおしゃれですがだったらトリュフナッツ食べればよかったと言うところです…	2
Ich kann das Produkt nicht empfehlen und sehe keine Veränderung im Hautbild. Klarer Fehlkauf 😏	2
It smells good other than that I didn't notice anything different in my skin.Won't buy again.	2
No lo recomiendo para las personas con piel seca tirando a normal.Antes de usar el producto tenía la piel sin granos,y llevo unas semanas usándolo y me ha destrozado la cara. Al menos a mí no me ha funcionado.	2
"So first of all, this product has a LAUNDRY LIST of ingredients... it's actually crazy how many things they've crammed in there.The smell is okay. I find it fine when you spray it but then it lingers all day, has a sort of ""old lady"" floral scent.Hydration? I don't know. My skin felt the exact same. I tried spraying a bunch on the back of my hand... it felt kind of oily for a while and then absorbed to nothing.Lastly, this product states clearly to NOT INHALE when spraying it. I've never seen that in a setting spray in my life. That is super questionable to me. Also questionable is that they covered up the old warning label that says to ""hold your breath"" when spraying it.The stuff honestly just sketched me out, and the results weren't worth whatever risk it has for inhaling it. Weird. Be cautious...."	2
Use makeup setting spray instead	2
よくあるおじさんの香水の匂いです。自分の顔からこの匂いが香ってくるのは無理でした。韓国のオリーブヤングで、テスターを手に吹きかけた時はこんな香りしなかったような…。ミストは割と大きめ？荒め？ですが、目にかかってしまっても沁みなかったです。キュレルのミストよりはオイルが入っているので乾燥はしにくいかなと思います。使用感は悪くないですが、香りが衝撃的すぎて同じような製品もたくさんあるので、わざわざこれを買う必要はないかなと思いました。匂いに少しでも敏感な方は本当にやめた方がいいです。マスクする前にこれ吹きかけたらマジで地獄。	2
No le veo nada de especial	2
No me parece un producto bueno. El olor es de cosmético barato, si te pulverizas agua con ese compuesto aceitoso es normal lo de la piel jugosa. No lo volvería a comprar	2
It’s a spray I’m not sure what the hype is al about the fact that people say they get “glass skin” is hilarious of course you do! You’re getting wet!!!! Returning I will stick to tatcha yes it’s more expensive but I like the ACTUAL dewy look I get from it and I don’t have to spray it 17 times LOL believe what you want but for me it’s basic..	2
I had heard all so much good stuff about this and after going through the bottle half way, i say save your money it leaves a weird after texture to the skin.After using it for a bit lightly yet consistently I started breaking out, the glow is a light shine but barely visible unless heavy coating which didn't work on my skin.	2
Lo compré por la publicidad y la composición que me pareció bastante buena, pero la sensación pegajosa que se queda en la piel es muy incómoda y no me gusta. Quizá en invierno no pase, pero en verano fatal.	2
Satisfecha	2
The product is fine but not having extra ordinary results. Might not buy again	2
El producto está bien normalito lo veo caro y no lo volveré a comprar	2
It just water with something.  My face is the same after the application.	2
Sinceramente se han lucido en publicidad y no es más que un agüita que además saca granos !!	2
No deja ese efecto flow que todos dicen. Es un tónico como hay muchos, muy caro para lo que es.	2
Lo venden como un producto que deja la piel radiante e hidratada.... Yo no noto nada y lo aplico antes de la crema y después del maquillaje	2
NOT eczema prone/dry/sensitive skin.Casually using this for about a year and recently started incorporating it more into my skincare routine. I noticed the high points on my cheeks (my usual eczema flareups) becoming extremely dry. For months i’ve wondered how my skin could feel so hydrated yet have such dry parches. Tried everything - bought new moisturizers, cleansers, etc  It wasnt until i took this product out of my routine that i soon realized it to be the culprit of an eczema reaction. Within 24 hours the scaling skin on my face was gone. I will continue to this on my neck and chest as those areas seem to handle it well but definitely not for the face anymore which is unfortunate because it does give that “glow from within” without feeling greasy.  perhaps this may be best suited for those who lean more oily skin type.	3
I tried this spray several times and each time it felt like little sharp pins going into my skin.  I was very surprised as it did not hurt but it was unpleasant.  About 1/2 hour later I had a rash on my chest and neck. I had my daughter try this and she had not issues. Will be giving it to her.  I was really surprised about this because the reviews for this product are great! I downloaded the OnSkin app and the d'Alba Italian White Truffle First Spray Serum rates 59/100. For my skin it has a moderate chance of clogging my pores. There are 4 ingredients in this product that are known allergens: Hexyl cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, and Citronellol.  I must be allergic to one of these ingredients but needless to say, I was excited about this product because of all the rave reviews but I will not be purchasing this again.	3
This product burns! I shaked it before I used it and closed my eyes when spraying, but it still got into my eyes. That burns! And then I felt a little itchy on the cheek area, so I ended up returning it. I think it's way too harsh on my skin.	3
I love face mists so I decided to try this one out considering it’s a number one seller on Amazon and honestly I am just not really impressed with this product and it is not making it into my standard skincare rotation. I’ll admit it has a nice fine mist and I don’t think there is actually anything wrong with it, it just doesn’t compete against what I am already using or add anything to my skincare routine.I’ve ended up keeping it my gym bag, along with another serum mist, to be apart of my post workout skincare to hold me over from when I wash my face at the gym until I get home	3
Not sure about this. It's nice when I spray in on my face, feels goods, smells nice but, as soon as it dries I notice mlno difference. I'll keep using the bottle but I won't reorder. I need see improvements to keep buying stuff like this.	3
The spray is ok, but I didn’t really get what’s the hype. On my combination skin, it didn’t really make much difference. However it left an oily circle stain on my furniture so make sure to wipe the bottle after use.	3
Having been reviewed by an influencer that I respected I was eager to try this product. But I have to say that I wasn’t enamored by it. I found it performance to be flat. I don’t feel Compelled to buy it again	3
Si no te agradan los olores fuertes este producto no es para ti , tiene un olor a almizcle . Que no me agrada para nada.	3
No es tan brillante como lo describen , al ponérsela en el rostro no se ve tan tersa e iluminada	3
It came in a sealed bag and some of the contents had spilled out. What happened to quality control?I did get a new one today that was in a sealed box(as it should be). I have tried it once and really like it.I find it hard to believe that they would send out a used, unboxed item.I am giving it 3 stars because of the one that came first.As far as the product itself, seems like it will be good.	3
I wanted to wait to try this product- i was using it every day and whike its refreshing- It did nothing for my skin-  itst just 90% water with 10 % of the oils and other ingredients - I would not buy again. Not great quality	3
I wanted to rave about this, but I don't feel like I notice a big change, personally. I have been using for about a month. Also, it smells funny, so I always feel weird breathing it in, lol.	3
While it does have a great spray nozzle and makes my skin dewy, it has a VERY strong scent. I put it under my makeup and the smell lingered for about an hour later. I don’t feel like it did much to my skin and really just felt oily.Not my favorite product.	3
If that’s your goal: to look shiny. Otherwise rather gimmicky because it doesn’t truly moisturize. Maybe it helps some feel relaxed? The scent is rather strong.	3
This product has a pleasant scent and does give hydration and glow to your skin. However, when it dries the hydration feeling is gone. I still liked it for the most. If the hydration lasted longer, I would have given it five stars.	3
The fragrance is too strong for my liking so I have been unable to use it. :(	3
Pleasant smell, but not sure if it actually does much else. Will have to see in the winter.	3
If u like your face looking like oil and shiny all this this is for u.	3
Creo que 3 estrellas es mucho para este producto. Esperaba más por las reseñas	3
Patch tested on my arm & nothing happened but a slight bit of redness. Sprayed on my face & my skin became red & itchy within 10 minutes. Very similar to when I've used too much Niacinamide. (My sensitive skin does *not* love Niacinamide and it's in almost everything now). This product definitely has a high percentage of Niacinamide, unfortunately for me.The smell is nice but it's not my favorite. I did notice a nice glow. I think I'm going to have to experiment with how to make this spray work for me once my skin has calmed down. Hopefully I can keep the glow & lose the irritation.*UPDATE*Day after first use and my face is very itchy with little red splotches. It has to be the Niacinamide that's causing the reaction.*Update #2*I'm definitely experiencing full blown contact dermatitis on my face.	3
I bought this at the end of April, it is now the end of June. I use this spray daily. Honestly, I don’t see a difference in my skin. Additionally, the “glow” only last about 2 minutes after putting it on. I will go back to using Rare beauty 4-in-1 midst. The rare beauty midst keeps me glowing for hours. Additionally, it brightens up my skin. This product is not worth the money imo.	3
Didn’t notice any difference it made.	3
Not sure how to feel about this spray. I have used it for a month. Haven’t seen much of a change in skin. Dewy look and feel. I will keep trying to out and see the results later.	3
I have no idea where the hype came from in these reviews. It’s nothing special for the price. Not worth it.	3
Did'nt give glow as stated very disappointed we hope Amazon tries his products,used on face	3
I noticed no remarkable difference when I used this spray.  My face didn't look moisturized or glowy.I also noticed a very strong smell of perfume.  I don't use perfume on my face or scented ingredients.  To be honest, the smell was lovely and if they have an actual BODY spray, I'm in but not on my face, that's a no no in my book.  Item returned.  ☺	3
I bought because all of the hype around this product. At the end of the day its just a dewy setting mist. Made me look too dewy. I prefer the morphe spray or the mac fix plus.	3
I'm using Korean products for face washing and it's making a big difference. I'm always looking for other products to compliment my routine. This White Truffle spray had great reviews, but luckily I ordered the small size to try it out because it didn't do anything. I don't really like the fragrance-it does dissipate quickly though. It just didn't do anything for my complexion. You have to hold your breath when you spray it too. Big hype, but no results.	3
I am sure it's great but not for me as I am prone to allergic reactions. Smells good for what I noticed.	3
Meh! I have dry skin and I like this, but not sure I see any benefits from it. I dont look glowy or moisturized. I tried under-and over makeup, at night before bed etc. no real results especially for the price. I will finish, but not repurchase.	3
I read the good reviews and the bad reviews on this product. I sort of agree with both. This spray has a lovely fine mist that creates a lovely lasting glow on your face. However, if you get it on your lips, don’t lick them. Yucky taste!  The smell is light, not strong and overpowering as some reviews have stated. Here’s the reason for only 3 stars: This product claims to have healthy ingredients. I’m not sure I believe that. The word “vegan” means that there are no animal products used. However, there can still be whole lotta unhealthy things used! Any list with this many unfamiliar long worded ingredients is questionable in my opinion. So there you go.	3
This was recommended to me, I ordered the small and haven’t used it for very long. I thought it would feel more moisturizing than it does. I will continue to use it and see if it’s something I want to reorder.	3
The product does leave the skin looking a bit glossy but after a few days, I started noticing a few breakouts. I try not to spray too much on my face. You can sort of smell the alcohol which caused irritation to my eyes. So avoid spraying around the eye area!!!!!!!!  I was expecting a bit of a different texture. For the price, I’m just going to say it’s an okay product…	3
I’ve only used the product a couple times and it’s okay. I’ve purchased other mist that seem to do the same. The scent is pleasant so I like it, we’ll see if this is worth the money after more use but so far it’s okayMy complaint here is really on the seller since the box came taped so I’m suspicious of that gave me a returned bottle. I’m using it this weekend so i’m keeping the bottle but I don’t think I will be buying from this seller in the future. I’m just not confident i’m getting a new bottle.	3
This product is just okay does nothing	3
nothing special smells like Granda from the 70s	3
feels great on the face, leaves my skin soft and glow-y, but the fragrance is overpowering. headache inducing. and considering you’re meant to spritz it on your face… it just seems a little silly to add such a strong fragrance. even when i hold my breath for as long as i can, it still invades my nose and throat. if this came fragrance free it’d be pretty close to being a perfect product. as it is, i probably will not repurchase. which is a shame because i want to love it!	3
After using for some time, the smell is not to my liking. I cannot describe the smell, but wet wood.  I guess truffles are mushrooms.	3
I have been using this every day and I have noticed nothing. I might as well be spritzing water on my face. The packaging is nice and the sprayer nozzle is fine. It disperses a nice mist. I am guessing there is some oil in there because I see separation if I don't shake it. But there is no oily feeling on my face. I live in a desert climate so my skin always feels a little dry. Perhaps if I lived in a more humid place would I notice a difference.	3
Love the cooling affect and softness of my skin after use.	3
This product makes skin glow upon use and is okay as a setting spray. However the presence of the oil seems really counterintuitive for a setting spray and made my makeup separate.There are only a few active ingredients in the formula but it just seemed a bit gimmicky to me. The smoothing effect was nice but nothing to write home about.Not for me. But for others, it may work better.	3
No brilla como dicen, no se nota	3
I ran out of my tatcha and this was slightly cheaper and a MUA on YT recommended this so I was like why not try it. I was shocked by how big this product was but felt that I needed to spray quite a bit, so that is a con. I think it would apply really well under makeup or OVER makeup (not to use in place of setting spray please note) just as a final mist to refresh and give dewy vibes because as a dry skin girl matte is not for me, but oh give me dewy and glowy. When I first spritzed it on last night, I did feel my skin was initially irritated by it, but it quickly calmed there is no sign of irritation today or breakout and i have sensitive skin so if a product is going to break me out, I would likely know 12-24 hours later. I still do prefer my tatcha as holy grail, but I like this to mix it up it is ULTRA lightweight and to me it didn't really have a scent. I thought this was Italian product but it's Korean so if you are into K skin give this a try	3
I don't like the way that it is separated and I don't like once I got a hold of it and it was delivered that it said to not spray near eyes or nasal openings or whatever so how do you spray it on your face safely?	3
I sprayed it on my face and started seeing red itchy spots appear within the hour… love the fragrance but I guess that might be what’s irritating. Sensitive skin beware…	3
About half way through the bottle and I’m not sure if this adds anything to my overall radiance or skin health. Just ok	3
I'm not too keen on the smell says nor to inhale. That's kind of hard when your spraying on your face.  Not impressed	3
Easy to use, it does give your skin that glow but doesn’t last all day, smells nice	3
The one thing I did like about this serum was that it was a spray on serum but other than that it didn't moisturize my skin enough. I tried using more to see if that would make it better but it didn't. I have really dry skin and it just wasn't enough for my skin so I gave it to a friend. I haven't heard how she likes it.	3
Been using this for 2 weeks now and don’t see any difference on my face.	3
Now, I love me a good facial mist. This one claimed to give a super dewy, moisturizing look and feel and I didn’t really get that from this spray. It’s just okay. I love my Glow Recipe Watermelon spray mist. That one really does feel moisturizing. I also like the HudaBeauty coconut facial spray-that one feels nourishing to the skin as well.	3
It is hydrating but the fragrance is soooo strong and does not dissipate.	3
Not sure why I purchased this, I think I wanted something for after I applied as and washed my facemask. I didn't see anything negative or positive. I don't feel like it's something I really need so I myself won't be purchasing it.	3
This was more glowy than dewy. My face feels dry and glowy so I recommend this for oily or combo skin not for dry skin.Def not glass like skin not terrible but pretty mid	3
This product smells like a rich old lady. I wish they made one with no fragrance. Overall it does what it suppose to do for a reasonable price.	3
It’s okay. Made my makeup look thicker and cakey. I think it would work better with little to no makeup.	3
Why when I received my order was there no container, almost no oil layer, and look no lid?.	3
I do like it but I think I was expecting more. It does give a nice glow but it doesn’t last. I’ll finish my bottle but will probably not repurchase.You do need to shake to mix it.	3
Cumple su función, deja la piel luminosa pero el aroma se metió por mi nariz y es bastante fuerte el olor, solo por eso le doy 3 estrellas porque estoy acostumbrada a usar productos en mi rostro que no tengan olor. Es muy fuerte para mi	3
I’ve been using this product daily and my skin is flaking in some spots and has a burning/sensitive sensation when I rinse it and put other products on which didn’t have before.  I followed the instruction which was to spritz approx 5 times onto the skin.  The dewy finish doesn’t last long.	3
I’ve used this and I do like it but it’s not that special…will not repurchase unless it’s on sale!  But it’s smells so different…hard to explain.  Not horrible but not the best either.  LOL	3
Water and rose oil is similar	3
Honestly I was influenced to get this by all the youtubers I saw recommending it. It does not live up to the hype… the fragrance is too strong and not for everyone and its not as hydrating as advertised. Just get a serum.	3
I bought this product as a facial spritz for my trip out west where there is no humidity and I am a total priss when it comes to my comfort. It smelled nice to spritz everywhere except my face, which got into my mouth.  The idea was to spritz my face, lock it in with a moisturizer. I ended up using Evian spray which is only water and some fancy moisturizer to lock all that goodness in.	3
El producto no me agrado por que,cuando quiero aplicar el producto en mi piel almomento de esprayarlo se tira por otro lado,eso es lo único mala.	3
So far this product seems to work nicely. Does not do very much. Does give a nice glow tho. Wish it was more hydrating.	3
It’s okay to use but it wasn’t as much as moisturizer as I expected when I sprayed first thing after washing face.	3
I like the product but,I do not like the fragrance it smells like cheap perfume little old ladies douse themselves with.I do not wear cheap perfume. It will clash with my perfume.If the product is revised, I suggest fragrance free.Plus, fragrances are not healthy for our faces anyway.	3
I bought this because of all the influencers talking about it . But it Made my face break out	3
Doesnt give me the affect that I want, and it’s quite irritating on my sensitive skin. Not worth it. It gives me glowy skin for like 10 minutes and my skin dry again :D the review said it’s good for makeup so dont trust it if you heard about it from any influencers.	3
This has such strong perfume smell, I almost returned it. Holy moly if you’re sensitive to smell skip this one!!	3
I bought this product while it was on sale and, glad I didn't paid full price.There are far more products for $36.00 in the market better than this. To me was a spritz of water and oil.	3
Did not meet my expectation.  Dewy look last only when wet.	3
I was expecting more from the product, the advertising show better results	3
I think it is working, though I don’t see those shiny skin on my face… I’m still figuring out how to use it in the correct way, without damaging my skin or breath	3
The product is okay but I can't get past their heavy perfume smell.  It seems like a heavy cheap perfume that someone has been wearing all day long mix with sweat.	3
what you pay	3
Lo presence por Los Buenisimo commentaries, es my grasoso si pones mucho asi Que te recomindo Que uses poco hidrata y suaviza	3
This product did not give me moisture or glow. I shared it with a friend and the same thing,  no moisture, no glow. I shook the bottle and sprayed liberally, still nothing.	3
A bit pricey!	3
Thai products made my face bumpy and dry.  In the process of returning.  Nothing is wrong with the product, it clearly didn’t work for me.	3
I saw this on tiktok and got influenced I should’ve left it there street having a bad reaction to it I had to toss it. It didn’t work for me I have dry textured skin so just be careful	3
Product gives a nice glow; not really a moisturizer though	3
This moisture spritzer is refreshing, especially in Colorado's arid climate. The mist is very fine and refreshing on a hot summer day when skin screams for moisture.  I think I could easily refill the bottle with rosewater and another light oil.	3
I’ve been using it for about a month or so , I didn’t notice any changes in my skin. Not really worth buying.	3
I like it has a great smell. It seems to hydrate my skin pretty well.	3
I don’t understand all the hype about this mist. There is nothing special about this.	3
I bought two bottles and I'm very disappointed I received one used.  I didn't try it yet	3
This has 3 pore-clogging ingredients and is not acne safe.	3
It worked fine for a week but after two weeks it started irritating my skin . I have a clear skin and have no issues with skincare usually but this definitely broke me into pimples.	3
I noticed an increase in acne after use.	3
I expected a real glow with this and unfortunately it isn’t what I thought it would be and after it dries it is slightly sticky. Instructions are in Korean and when you use the QR code to get English instructions it doesn’t work.	3
it's a very hot item on tiktok, that why I gave it a try. I waited until fall when my skin getting started drying a little bit. It leaves the  skin glow but doesn't last too long and the smell is too strong, like perfume.After I used it for 1 weeks It gave me a bit whitehead acne on my forehead so I'm not recommending sensitive and oily skin. But I'll try one more time	3
Not for me. Allergic reaction to this product	3
This product has a delicate, luxurious smell which I absolutely love. Id wear n it as a perfume if they made one! However, it does not stand up to the claims of ultimate hydration. I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to break-outs. While it did provide a soothing comfort when applied, it lasted maybe an hour for me. (It did not break me out).	3
Good	3
It's not worth the hype.	3
スプレータイプの保湿力の高い化粧水が欲しくて購入しました。・粒子はそこまで細かくはありません。ミスト・・というまでは行かない感じです。・使い勝手はとても楽です。・保湿力は正直あまり感じませんでした。さっぱりタイプという感じです。春～夏頃にかけて使用し始めたので、乾燥は感じてませんが、保湿はいうほどじゃないように感じます。・香り　これが結構私は苦手でした。昔の化粧品の匂いに感じます。細かい部分で期待したほどでなかったところはありますが、総じてまぁ悪くないというかんじです。スプレーで楽ちんで、お肌もちゃんと潤います。	3
I'm combining this serum with other products from the Ordinary and I wouldn’t be able to say if it is better than a hyaluronic acid of O.	3
メイクの仕上げやリフレッシュしたいときに使っています！コンパクトなので旅行のときなどにも活躍しました！！	3
"Edit 2/13/24: After two weeks of use, I wanted to update my review. I did find that if I use this too much or too often it will start irritating my skin a little bit (as in I get minor breakouts). I am more acne prone, and do tend to break out slightly when using anything with niacinamide in them or even certain facial oils, but not too much. The effects of this spray is still really great in terms of hydrating and making skin look more plump and glowy. So I've found ways to work this into my routine that I found works for me:-using only *one* spray on each side of the face-not using this as my very first step, but after a hydrating serum to give it a little buffer-using this only 2-3x a week spaced out - as another reviewer here said, the glow does seem to last longer than a day even after I wash my face, so I use that to my advantage and space out my usage. if I see the glow fading (usually after two or three days for me) or I look particularly dry, I spray upAll in all, I like the effects of this serum. While I don't know if I can use it everyday I will continue to find ways to use it, especially since it looks awesome as a setting spray after makeup - really smooths and softens everything out while giving a nice dewy glow.I did change my review from the original 5 to 4 stars for minor irritation factor.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, so wow. I did have high hopes for this spray, and so far, it does not disappoint. I sprayed it on half my face as a first step after cleansing this morning, and I must say, the side that I sprayed, my face is way more plump, supple, glowy and vibrant, and because of this, even looks more youthful. The sprayed side is definitely hydrated in the way that it looks *and* feels. Yes, I can even move my face more freely because it's so well-hydrated as opposed to the side that I didn't spray. The non-sprayed side is definitely more drier from my mineral sunscreen and I can feel the dryness when I move my face and talk. I have dry to combo sensitive skin, and this has not irritated my skin thus far. I was more than anything wondering if it would clog pores but I think the niacinamide works well with the oils so that that doesn't happen. Something about the way this is formulated, it's well-put together so everything works really well for the intended effect. One thing I will say - it does have a strong smell. When I first sprayed it I thought it smelled so strong, but so familiar. And then I realized, ""So this is what I must've been smelling on those flights to Korea."" I vaguely remember on my trips to Korea, the planes having a faint wisp of this scent. It really just reminds me of Korea when I visited, and now I know why. A lot of people probably were using this spray and for good reason. And, for the amazing effect, I'm willing to live with the fragrance. Overall, loving this spray."	4
Wanted to love this product. Been researching more on Korean skincare and this came up and has high ratings however I used for about two weeks before and after applying my makeup. Now I’m a dry face girly and I saw this product on a YouTube “products for dry skin” it smells amazing!!! I wanted to love it but it did not moisturize or leave my skin dewy or feeling refreshed. I unfortunately would not recommend for dry skin or if you think this is going to be “glass” skin like	4
Para mi buen producto lo compraría nuevamente	4
I recently tried d'Alba Italian White Truffle First Spray Serum, and while I appreciate its luxurious feel and the hype surrounding it, I found it to be less hydrating than I expected. The serum has a pleasant scent and a refreshing mist that feels nice on the skin. However, I was hoping for more intense hydration, especially given its reputation among flight attendants. It’s a good product, but if you need deep moisture, you might need to layer it with other products.	4
Love this product very moisturizing light, use it more than once a day..  on autoship and I am fussy!!	4
El producto es bueno pero esperaba tener una sensacion de mayor hidratacion. Buena opcion precio calidad.	4
I only knew about this bc of BTS. Having been curious, I found it here and I like how it feels and the quality is good and smells great.  The ease of use fits into my skin care routine.  Having said (written) that I hope this product is not sold out.	4
The spray bottle is excellent in producing fine mist. I used it only once. My skin felt pretty smooth after it dried out. But I had to give it away since the fragrance is quite strong and started to give me a headache. Such a pity--it is probably a great product for people who don't mind the fragrance.	4
Lo he utilizado 4 veces y no veo un efecto glow como el que ofrecen e RRSS. Quizá a largo plazo funcione muy bien. Huele bien, no espectacular	4
Very good product	4
It keeps my skin nice and glossy but it gives me acne	4
Love this serum mist!! The hype is real. I love how it smells like expensive skincare. Not a strong scent though. Very fine mist and leaves your face nice and glowy, especially for dry skin like me I love this! Will be repurchasing	4
it’s smell good but not over power, my skin doesn’t react to the smell. it doesn’t really do what it said, I barely see any hydration. 7/10.	4
It’s quite expensive for refreshing spray but fortunately, it’s more than that. I use it before and after make up for moisture and glowy	4
I bought this product ans it keeps my face smooth. The smell it is a bit strong but not much I usually put a towel so I don't get itvon my clothes when I spray it.	4
I like it so much I bought it in a travel size too, so I don’t have to be without it! It makes my skin feel more moisturized, and I like the experience of a spray in the summertime, it’s cooling and lightweight. The sprayer is a fine mist too.	4
Ami  NO me gustó	4
Creo que me deja la piel más grasosa que lo normal pero en general soy de piel grasa	4
Smell fresh. I spray on last after I put my powder & blush to eliminate dryness from cosmetic powder. It gives a smooth dewy look. Doesn't feel greasy, it gives a light dewy shine w light spritz.	4
This is a lovely hydrating mist/serum. It's fantastic for mature skin and if you can get it on sale go for it! My only issue is that it is scented, I have sensitive rosacea skin so I prefer a fragrance free product for my face. If you don't mind fragrance on your face, treat yourself.	4
Well, in the last few days I have seen some results, I recommend it to	4
First noticed that the scent was very strong but I think I'm getting used to it.  My bottle had very little oil at the top compared to the ones advertised.  The oil was what was important to me, that's why I bought it in the first place.  I wanted that shiny glow look.  It took almost two weeks to get probably because it was at a special price.  Will update my review after I've used it for a week or two.  I want to give it a fair rating after that.	4
It makes your makeup look amazing. However, I have somewhat sensitive skin, and I found that it causes breakouts.	4
Help moisturizing the skin before makeup	4
Eh its alright it works well to melt makeup into ur skin but its not like the best thing in the world. kinda mid, but does make u glowy for a little bit	4
I’m very cautious about what I use on my skin, because it is prone to acting up. I’ve been using this for about a week or two now and I think it’s safe to say it’s not causing any issues - or is doing more good than bad. I use it before applying makeup, and after I wash my face. It feels and looks luxurious, and I want to say it’s helped to clear my face up. Only time will tell! Will update review to 5 stars if all continues well.	4
Product gives the perfect glow!	4
I like spraying it right after my toner or if I don’t have a toner next to me that’s the first thing I put. I like the feel of it. It’s light weight and moisture my face right away. I have a combo skin and I still have to put a crème on after this spray but overall, I like the feel of it.	4
I like it alot im just not seeing results. Feels super luxury but still TBD if I would repurchase it	4
Love this serum as a daily go to for my skincare routine. Nothing super special besides it hydrates beautifully. Gets the job done without causing breakouts.	4
My wife has very sensitive skin and is able to use it without a problem. If my wife likes it then I like it. Worth the cost. Will purchase again.	4
Love the spray serum, smells good too👍	4
This is my second tone purchasing this item , love how it gives me a glow	4
Nice scent ,nice mist not irritating	4
I have to say I do like the truffle spray , it leaves your face feeling soft and refreshed, with a hint of a glow. I will say is I didn’t like after I fixed my hair then used the spray,it sprayed on my hair as well making it unmanageable to work with it was to soft after that. So the next time I used it, I put a head band on, so it didn’t spray into my hair. Other than that little issue , I love it !	4
I didn’t notice much of a glow in my skin after using this product, as was promised. I did notice my skin softer to the touch and the texture seemed to even out, but I do use a few other skin care products so it could be from those. If you are expecting drastic results in a few days, you will be disappointed. Giving it a generous 4 stars because I don’t hate it. Probably would buy again. Smells kind of weird but doesn’t linger after absorbing.	4
Very nice scent but it looked like it was partially used? Like it wasn’t filled to the top, it looked like it had been used ?	4
This spray is like silk. It feels great on the skin. It has a rose scent. I am on the fence if it’s a purchase more than once product- but I do like it.	4
I use this when I need a great refresher I am trying different products at the moment it works well but I’m not going to determine this as great.	4
Tiene un aroma delicioso y me gusta los resultados	4
first time using it, I liked it, don't know if I would repurchase just because it's nothing special but I did like it	4
I have two bottles. My skin feels dry during winter, but during warmer weather, it works much better.	4
This product is wonderful at giving a quick boost of hydration, moisture, and GLOW. You can put this on right after cleansing, in between skincare steps, or even as a finishing spray for makeup to add extra glow.Make sure to shake before use as it’s a biphase formula. The sprayer itself is nice and dispersed the mist evenly and lightly, no random splotches of product shooting into your eye or anything like that. The scent is kind of floral-like, it’s not super strong but if you dislike fragrance maybe avoid this one.Overall not a must buy, but a nice to have if you’re looking for a quick hydration / glow, especially with makeup. Otherwise this doesn’t do anything that a hydrating toner/essence, or dewy setting spray wouldn’t do. Id recommend buying this on sale, personally don’t think it’s worth the full price!	4
I love anything in a mist pretty much. This was super easy to use. My skin felt super hydrated.	4
My skin feels so hydrated and looks glowy after spraying this on my face. I love using it on every step of my skincare and makeup routine because the result is so much better!One thing i was a little concerned about is the directions say that it's recommended not to breathe it in. I'm only concerned in the fact that it might* have ingredients that may not be so good for us but that will require more research.Other than that, really love this spray, and it does what it claims.	4
Slight oil to nicely moisturize with other serums. The aroma is slightly too strong,  but it evaporates immediately.	4
Pensé que daba más brillo en la piel no me gusta mucho no se nota como vi en anuncios no lo volveré a comprar	4
An extra glowing product for make up	4
I’m not sure if I purchased the wrong thing but I don’t see a lot of yellow stuff at the top of my bottle.	4
I love the smell and it give you glow, this is my skin after I woke up but I've been using it for a month now. I don't know if it does something on my skin though. It's nice as a make up prep spray. Your foundation will blend well on skin and reduce cakeyness.	4
I definitely got swayed by the raving reviews. Looks nice on the skin for a few minutes but then it makes no noticeable difference. Instead, my skin seems to react negatively to it, possibly due to the fragrance. It feels like only half of what sprays out actually lands on the skin and then instead of sinking in, the oils just sits there and the rest evaporates. It’s a bummer because it was a splurge item for me and it disappoints every time I use it.Edit: I was able to give to someone who loves it! This brand also has excellent customer service.	4
Not sure if it benefits my skin much yet but I will say it’s refreshing , has a light scent and is satisfying to spray on	4
Leaves my skin glowing, feels a slight bit sticky after but nothing overbearing or gross feeling.	4
Hidrata con un brillo y un aroma únicos. Es genial, la volvería a comprar	4
A nice light mist that seems to provide enough moisture without being overly greasy. Would buy it again.	4
Work great but the scents are a little strong for me but it go away after a while after I spray it on	4
Tu piel cambia , a mejor , y dura el dia completo no se retira ❤️	4
"I was looking forward to more ""glow"", but it suffices. It's a notch up from the rose water I've used."	4
Just ordered 2nd bottle. Got recommended by cousin and bought to try. It smells nice and absorbed very quickly. Just have to close eyes while spraying otherwise it stings pretty badly.	4
I use this serum before make up like toner and after make up like setting spray. It make my face shiny and more moisture. I voted 4 star, because 2 or 3 days first, I have a little irritation, it isn’t burning, just itchy some spots. It look good now.	4
The reviews on this would make one think that it’s some sort of miracle spray. It’s not. I mean, it’s fine but I prefer my stuff from The Ordinary way better. Wouldn’t buy again but it’s ok!!	4
Para darle luminosidad a la cara	4
It’s a good and pleasant product. Is it going to transform your skin? No. I use it instead of a toner or essence. Smells amazing though	4
The media could not be loaded.Nice glow, great sprayer, but you can feel it on the skin. Not greasy at all, sticky yes!Leaves a film, not hydrating but glowy.	4
It leaves the skin with an amazing idol-like glow but the smell although is nice it’s pretty strong. I haven’t feel or notice any skincare benefit from it. It’s a nice finish product if you’re willing to spend, but totally unnecessary.	4
This product gives a real pretty glow. I spray before bed and it last all night.	4
Works good.	4
Moisturize my skin! Love it!	4
I love this serum. Just wish it sprayed more like a gentle mist, instead my nozzle spits the serum at me. lol.	4
This product will make your skin glow and will make your face looks fresh.	4
I like the serum it does give me a glow. On my second bottle	4
The media could not be loaded.Only thing is you need to shake it because the ingredients separate when not used. Did not irritate my skin and felt hydrated	4
I tried out this serum for the first time over my foundation-it wasn’t sticky or heavy at all and felt very cool against my skin! It settled nicely into my skin, felt very hydrating and gave me a little extra glow!	4
it has a nice smell and does feel pretty moisturizing but yeah idk its cute or whatever	4
The media could not be loaded.Didn’t like the appeal of oil seats on top	4
Definitely hydrating. I took off 1 star as I found the scent pretty strong. Looking forward to seeing the long term results. Already recommended to one friend.	4
good	4
I love how convenient this product.Gives me instant glow and hydrates my skin. I thought its gonna have like a truffle smell but I’m surprised it has a great mild scent. I also like that is a mist spray.	4
I love this product and it made my skin radiant and shiny. However the scent is very strong and make me headache. Is there a same product but without any scent? Thanks	4
This was really hydrating. I thought it was going to be more oily but I was pleasantly surprised. It’s very lightweight. I felt fine using it during the summer months and under makeup. I use this all day!	4
Firstly I loved the smell of the mist, it can’t completely moisturise the skin but works well under your moisturiser.	4
Hydrating!!!  Feels good on the skin and makes you glowy!!	4
Makes my skin very glowy!But the smell is the only thing that’s making me not want to use it…I’m pretty sensitive to scent and was hoping the smell will go away overtime but it stay for a while.	4
Thank you it’s very nice.	4
It took a while then my husband said you smell like roses	4
I like this product bc luminate and glows skin. But, not to much hydration for mature skin.	4
Light and refreshing	4
d'Alba is good not as excellent as it was made out to be but good none the less.	4
I was presenting the incorrect information!  It was not this bottle!  Love it… my apologies!	4
"It smells nicely. It gives some very light moisture on my skin. But I am not sure what benefit this product has really. Most of the times my skin gets those small red speckles, like irritation after every use. So instead I've been using it as a body spray once in a while, as it does smells nice and refreshing.Because the ""oil"" or whatever yellow substance is, separates from the white transparent liquid, you have to shake it well before using it.I do like how this serum gave my skin a nice burst of moisture without feeling greasy or heavy. It is lightweight, and I make sure the mist distributes throughout my face so I'm sure to not miss a spot. I use this when I'm at home and spraying this on my face, several times throughout the day as needed.The only thing that must be causing an allergy on my face is that it has added scent and my skin is quiet sensitive lately to everything that has perfume or scents.I'd recommend it. Yes. You'll enjoy it"	4
Me encantó el producto porque deja glow en el rostro pero no te go muy claro si usarlo luego del skin care y luego del maquillaje o antes. Si alguien sabe ❤️	4
The media could not be loaded.Si te gusta bastante el glow, es el adecuado, para mi me deja muy brillante, sella el maquillaje sin estropearlo. Recomendado	4
I like the convenience of a spray serum, and it does what it says to add glow. I used it o er make up as a setting spray snd to lessen the look of my powder. It is impossible to keep froSpraying on your lips, and it tastes gross like licking a bar of soap.	4
I honestly like it. But it’s false advertisement. Says made in Italy. Then on the back everything is in Chinese writing and says made in China. So who even knows what ingredients are in this	4
Thanks 🙏	4
If you’re looking for a lightweight mist/primer, this will be for you. The scent is not overwelming. Not greasy at all.	4
I like the glow it gives your face. Very light but refreshing and hydrating.	4
Great product!	4
I feel like this product is just okay. I wouldnt buy this for the full 35 dollars, i feel like thats not worth it. I bought it when it was 50% off btw. The scent is okay but im usuallt not into fragrance in skincare	4
EDIT: The company contacted me after seeing my 3-star review and offered a refund cause I wasn’t satisfied. Adding an extra star for great customer service.REVIEW: .Since I got into Korean skincare I was curious about this highly recommended mist. I finally decided to spend the money and see what’s it’s all about. Waited until fall when my skin started getting a bit dry during the day, and tried this one instead of applying an additional layer of moisturizer in the afternoon  when needed. Well, it definitely adds a glow like it promises, but you have to spray more than suggested to achieve that moisturized level, at least for me. Plus the smell when sprayed  is  not pleasant, and keep your lips tightly closed cause the taste is awful as well. I used it 3-4 times and I can tell it won’t last long seeing how much I have to use in one go. So, once I finish, I’ll go back to using a lotion during the day when skin feels dry. Maybe its main purpose is for the plane rides like it originally started in Korea, who knows. Overall, nice luxury product, but not really needed.	4
I recently incorporated a beauty spray into my skincare routine, and I can't help but share my positive experience with this remarkable product. Not only does it deliver on its promises, but it has also garnered me countless compliments on my skin's appearance.**Efficacy:**The beauty spray truly does what it says—providing an instant boost of brightness and glow to my skin. Upon first use, I noticed a refreshing, radiant finish that transformed my complexion from dull to revitalized. This spray has become my go-to product for adding that extra luminosity, whether I’m preparing for a busy day or an evening out.**Ingredients:**I've looked into the ingredient list, and it's impressive. The blend includes hydrating components like hyaluronic acid and soothing botanical extracts that not only enhance brightness but also nourish the skin. Knowing that the formula is both effective and beneficial gives me confidence in using it regularly.**Application Process:**The application is straightforward and enjoyable. The fine mist dispenses evenly, providing a refreshing sensation without any sticky residue. I typically use it throughout the day, either over my makeup or on bare skin, and it instantly revitalizes my look without disturbing my makeup base.**Results:**One of the best aspects of this beauty spray is the consistency of results. Every time I use it, I am met with a luminous finish that has drawn compliments from friends and family alike. This boost in confidence is priceless; I find myself feeling more self-assured and glowing, which reflects in my overall demeanor.**Portability:**Additionally, the size of the spray bottle makes it highly portable. I can easily toss it in my bag for either a quick refresh during the day or as part of my travel essentials. It’s great to know I can maintain that bright, beautiful finish anytime, anywhere.**Overall Impression:**In summary, this beauty spray has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, ease of use, and positive feedback from others. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to achieve brighter, healthier-looking skin. It truly delivers on its promises, making it a fantastic addition to any skincare routine. Don't be surprised if you start receiving compliments as soon as you start using it!	5
The Nice Truffle Mist Facial Spray is a luxurious addition to any skincare routine. Infused with truffle extract, it delivers a burst of hydration and a subtle, earthy scent that feels indulgent. The mist is fine and even, making it perfect for setting makeup or refreshing the skin throughout the day. Users rave about its soothing properties and how it leaves the skin with a dewy, glowing finish. A must-try for those looking to add a touch of elegance to their skincare regimen.	5
"I made this purchase on an influencer recommendation (James Welsh). This feels very refreshing, there is a slight fragrance, I can't put my finger on what it is, it is not offensive, rather clean smelling, leaves my skin feeling hydrated and glowing. I liked this so much that I ordered a second one (when Johnny Ross - who also gave it a good review told his audience that there was a discount being offered) before my first one was even 1/2 used (because there was a sale offered on it). I do have ""normal skin""."	5
The first day I used it I couldn’t believe how beautiful and glowing my face looked, I like to apply this first after washing my face and then i apply another face product, I  tried to apply after my other face product that I usually use every morning but i liked the results it gave me soo much better by applying this first!  it makes my face look so amazing, I also I noticed my make up foundation looks so much nicer and my face looks glowing and smooth.	5
So I'm a face care newbie at 52.  I've always had soft smooth skin and take basic care of it.  But now in my 50s, I am noticing more dryness and wrinkles and sun damage.  I don't usually like anything sprayed on my face, but during the day, when my face feels a bit dry or tight, I spray this on so it won't mess up my blush or eye make-up.  The mist is really fine, feels nice and smells nice.  It's a clear liquid with what looks like yellow truffle oil that floats on top.  I shake it up and give a couple of sprays on my face and neck.  It works really well to hydrate my face.	5
I rarely ever repurchase a skincare product that I find to be over my typical budget (the price on this spray fluctuates between 18-33 dollars constantly,) that is, until this product came along.I have combo/dry skin that gets super dry during winter, and oily yet parched during summer. I needed a spray that felt moisturizing yet sinks into skin seamlessly at the same time, and also made me feel refreshed. After seeing Tina Tanaka Harris rave about this spray in many of her videos, I ended up purchasing a bottle some time around early spring, and boy-was it love at first spritz. Immediately after mixing the bottle and spraying I knew I was going to love it. It moisturizes my skin to the point the cracks around my nose were kept at bay. At first it may appear greasy, but over time it dries into a smooth, velvety finish on my skin. And the smell, weirdly enough, does not bother me, (It has a nice, natural citrusy-smell, nothing chemical-smelling.) Lastly, the feeling of the spray on my skin just felt so luxurious and refreshing, I don't always have to spritz throughout the day, but when I do I'm in for a treat.The one MAJOR gripe I have about this product is the quantity/size. It comes in an average-sized bottle which personally I feel like doesn't match the pricing. I wish they had a bigger size, because I find myself constantly running out of the spray 4-6 weeks later, which RARELY ever happens when I use face sprays, (my alternative go-to is the Caudalie grape water, which has an even bigger bottle that has last me 6 months.) The ONLY reason why I'm willing to continue repurchasing is because the few times that I ran out I IMMEDIATELY could tell my skin felt different without it, and often not in a good way. With winter around the corner, it's even more crucial that I find a spray that is moisturizing enough for my skin once it starts changing.Overall, I'm giving this product a 5/5. It's a godsend for dry/combo skin, and often feels like a luxury experience in a bottle. The only downside I have is that I wish they came up with a jumbo size. I generally recommend to everyone, especially dry skin types.A little tip for oily skin types: If you find the spray to be greasy on your skin, I learned that not mixing the spray and just spritzing the watery part can work just as well without the oil. As for sensitive skin types, this mist does appear to have alcohol and parfume, but as someone who struggles with sensitivity I've yet to experience any negative side effects. That being said, always make sure to patch test any skincare product before applying incorporating it into your skincare as a precaution.	5
In the two short weeks that I’ve been using this product, I’ve already noticed a tremendous improvement and change in my skin. I’m a 48-year-old post-menopausal woman with mostly dry skin and larger pores with freckling and light scarring from acne in my younger years. I’ve tried to become more dedicated to taking care of my skin and creating a regular skincare routine, but not only do I tire of it, but my skin is fickle. What it likes today, and what works today, doesn’t tomorrow.Over the years, I have become more and more learned of Korean skincare, but I’ve ALWAYS LOVED “traditional” French/European skincare products, though they are SO expensive, and sometimes too heavy for my skin. This spray offers the BEST of both worlds. The delivery and approach and quality is very definitely Korean skincare-like. The ingredients, however, are very reminiscent of those found in French Provençal skincare… especially the truffles. The smell of the spray could be a perfume for those of us, who love the smell of the French Countryside. It’s Provence in a bottle.As for me, after cleansing (evening) or rinsing/refreshing (morning) my face and  décolletage, I will generously apply the spray to those areas and allow it to dry before moving on with the rest of my morning routine (sunscreen/moisturizer, then makeup), or just finishing up with that in the evening. I’ve been so impressed with this spray, however, that I am going to next purchase the serum/cream duo. I am just waiting for a good price, as I live on a more meager budget. Next time this spray goes on sale (I purchased the large bottle for $18.), I will purchase a couple of bottles.I hope you enjoy this product as much as do I, and as I experience more improvements, I will try to update my review.	5
My skin just LOVES this product.  I’m on my third bottle now.  If I’m too lazy to do makeup, I spray this product on my skin and it gives a beautiful glow!  Or when my skin feels dry, I love using this mist to give a quick hydrating pick me up.  Holy grail & I cannot do without.	5
I’m in love with this spray serum! I use this after washing my face at night and my skin eats this stuff up! Sometimes I’ll use it throughout the day over my makeup if my skin is feeling a bit dry. Highly recommend for those with dry, tight skin. It doesn’t feel oily either.	5
I was skeptical. But this product is exactly what I wanted. I have dry skin. And I am in the sun alot.I use this before my make up. After it's applied and I had to refresh. It has changed my skin and reduced the appearance of of my years on my face. I use it with the balm stick	5
I use this daily as a setting spray after I put on makeup.It smells amazing and really seal my makeup for the day.  It lasts hours until I go home from work.They have sold me and I am a true customer for life.	5
OMG!  Where has this been!  I love how my face looked after I spray this! Feels and looks refresh and my skin is softer and firmer! Love it! Next time I will buy the larger bottle!	5
I like this product it’s good for my sensitive skin doesn’t cause me to break out nice subtle glow does well on top of my other skin products	5
Was completely influenced to by this by Nikki La Rose and another YouTube makeup artist and I’m not mad about it. I have dry skin and have had issues with my makeup sticking to dry patches, flaking or just looking dull on my face. I like to do my makeup in a way that will have it last from morning all the way up to when I wash it off at the end of the night- which means I have my liquid/cream layer and powders over top. If you have dry skin like me you know that powders can often times just accentuate dryness and also appear cakey if not done correctly when applied over creams/liquids. Up until this point Charlotte tilbury was my go to setting spray because it has done the best at making my makeup look less makeupy, blending everything seamlessly and for the most part hiding my dryness. It wasn’t perfect but it was the best.THEN I was told about this stuff. Let me tell you, this will never not be in my arsenal of holy grails. I did my makeup as usual, experienced the few dry patches I sometimes run into even though I have done all the skin prepping and hydrating both nightly and morning before applying my makeup. I sprayed this on as my final step- shook it a few times and sprayed just 3 sprays on my face (that’s all you need trust me!) and Oh MY GOD- my makeup looks FLAWLESS.Again I use this as a setting spray so I can’t speak to its serum properties and what it does for bare skin- I’m sure it’s lovely- but it melted my creams/powders together in a way that completely erased pores and hid my fine lines. It doesn’t feel gross or heavy on the skin. It does have a bit of a scent that does last some time but it’s not offensive in anyway and my husband didn’t notice it.Overall, love this product I hope it never goes away. It’s been added to my subscriptions.	5
I love this mist.  The smell isn't too overpowering, but if you're really sensitive to smells, this may not be for you.  I have dry, mature skin and this helps with hydration.  It doesn't make my face shiny.  It just helps it not look so dry and flat when I put on makeup.	5
Vi este producto y busqué y tiene muy buenas reseñas, a penas lo estoy utilizando y huele muy rico y se siente bien en la piel, te deja un glow en la piel que es 100/10	5
Love this product, have been using it for a while and stopped when I ran out, but needed to purshace again! Its lightweight and makes your skin look like glass skin, highly recommend if you have a simple skin care routine	5
Nunca imagine el cambio tan rápido de; mi de tono de piel, como esta más brillante y más hidratada. Excelente producto.	5
I bought this, because it was a TikTok recommendation and it did not disappoint. My skin loves it. I use it as my first step in my skincare routine and sometimes my last step.I like the scent, it's very elegant. It absorbed nicely into my skin and helps prep my skin for the next step of my skincare routine.	5
I’m on my third bottle of this stuff! The smell is great and it makes my skin feel hydrated after using. Will continue to buy!	5
Trust me, BUY IT!!! So amazing. I use it before applying makeup and after to set it. Reduces appearance of fine lines and smells so good! Also evens out skin . Make sure you shake it before you use it every time	5
I’ve been testing out facial sprays and this one has been the most moisturizing by far. It sprays on easily and a little goes a long way. Not only is it refreshing, but it absorbs really well and leaves your skin feeling plump. It has some weight to it so it actually feels like you’re using a product that is doing its job. But not so heavy it feels greasy or like a layer of cream on your face.	5
Deja la piel reluciente y glowy!!! Este no será el último. Desde ya forma parte de mi rutina de skin care. Lo uso antes del maquillaje y antes de dormir como parte de mi rutina.	5
This is the best serum spray! I use it twice a day. Once to set my makeup and in the afternoon for a touch up.  When its on sale, I buy at least 2 of these!!  A must have to keep your makeup looking fresh and a classy finish.	5
Me encanta te pongas maquillaje o solo en tu cara con tus cremas queda bello	5
This product is great. It’s super hydrating and it makes you look so glowy. It makes you look like you have natural glass skin. It’s also super lightweight and very hydrating.	5
Cumple las espectativas iniciales, se vera a lrgo plazo	5
Aunque no lo he usado por mucho tiempo siento que si funciona bien humecta la piel deja una sensación de humectación, y de una piel más viva, me ha gustado mucho.	5
Me encanta cero grasa y la piel lindisima	5

This has to be the best face spray I have ever used. Love..love..love it.  Subtle glow is perfect.	5
My skin is beautiful	5
Muy bueno, lo recomiendo..gracias	5
Very light texture, medium size bottle. Easy to use sprays very soft. Leaves the skin looking dewy and glowing. Very light product. A slight scent. I’m really liking how my skin looks and feels. You do need to shake the product before use. It’s vegan so really seems to be of good quality and really does wonders for your skin. This will definitely be a product on my regular shopping list. I have yet to see how it will work with my makeup on.	5
Es muy producto q deja la piel con un brillo espectacular y el.maquillsje dura por más tiempo.	5
Delightful treat for your face, keep it in the fridge… feels so nice straight from the fridge.	5
Es muy refrescante, si da un brillo bonito	5

It has evened my skin texture. Very effective. Absorbs quickly. Gives a beautiful glow to my skin. And it's light. You can add more skincare on top of it.	5

Aplus	5
This face mist is so light and smells amazing. I keep mine in the refrigerator and it is so refreshing. JUNGKOOK of BTS uses this and I just had to have it. It’s the best face mist I’ve ever tried. Highly recommend it.	5
It feels amazing - so nourishing to my skin. I can’t stop spraying it all day :)	5
I use this before my moisturizers or after makeup it leaves me looking dewy and glowy	5
Excellent product	5
Su aroma y su textura perfecta y mi piel muy hidratada todas las mañanas .	5
Bought this for my face because I have been swimming several times a week this summer and didn’t want to use anything with alcohol based products. So many products contain a substantial amount of alcohol in the first few ingredients. I tried it as soon as it arrived and have been using it every night before bedtime. Leaves my face feeling moisturized and so smooth. Lightweight and really easy to apply in about 4 spritzes, my face feels and looks great. Try it and I’m sure you’re going to love it.	5
I don’t know if it’s just the illusion of having moisturized and healthy skin and I don’t care because dang, it really works! Smells nice too. I’ll be using this every morning for the rest of eternity. They don’t sell it at Sephora so I’m guessing this is a best kept secret.	5
I travel a lot, and I love spraying this on my face throughout the day. It gives you a glowing look, and keeps you face looking hydrated.	5
Another Korean skincare product that is so soothing to the skin. I have put this on subscription. I really feel how moisturizing this is	5
La bruma huele bien; hace su cometido! Pero siento no es imprescindible en la rutina aún no se, si lo volvería a comprar!	5
Te deja la piel sedosa!!!	5
Gave me a beautiful glow	5
Muy buen producto y me hace un glow espectacular 😍😍😍😍😍	5
I don't know if this does anything to my face I'm 70. What much can it do but I love how it feels. It is cooling. It gives my face a glow.I just love it I will continue to buy it.	5
I love. how this product works in my sensitive skin, I recommend this product!	5
Me encanta no es pegajoso y si se nota la diferencia mi cutis estás espectacular los cambios se notan lo recomiendo	5
It worth it to purchase during sale. Smells nice. Light and moitsuri. Sometimes feels a little bit sticky on the skin.	5
Me gusto que deja un glow increíble	5
i use this all time time even setting my make up	5
Truly an awesome product! I use this with my rosewater and glycerin spray as well and my face just looks so hydrated and dewy.	5
This spray works amazing on my face! Love the after glow it has!!	5
I use this right after washing my face, before applying actives and moisturizer. It feels great and has the perfect mist. I highly recommend.	5
The first day I used it I could tell this will stay in my skincare routine.Slight but fresh fragrance that diapears.  Love this!	5
I like this, it’s an easy spray that has genuinely helped with getting rid of pimples and zits for sure! It does help with those black heads that are raised on the skin as well! The smell is really nice too, reminds me of just a clean and fresh smell, definitely buying again!	5
It leaves my skin beautiful, illuminated and radiant.	5
Huele delicioso y deja la piel perfecta	5
Great spray toner	5
It is very hydrating and it makes my skin glow.Pros.1. Hydrating2. Gives a healthy glow3. Nice scentCons.1. Oil separates2. Use up quickly	5
This stuff is amazing! I have skin that can get oily easy and very dry easy as well. This product is light and hydrating but not oily to break my skin out (which normally products do). I truly will buy this again and love the way it makes my skin look after using.	5
Makes my skin soft hydrated and glowy. Will definitely make mention of this in my upcoming YouTube channel and social media platforms	5
The media could not be loaded.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I am absolutely in love with the d'Alba Piedmont Italian White Truffle First Spray Serum! This product has been a game-changer for my skincare routine. From the very first use, I noticed a significant difference in the hydration and glow of my skin. The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy residue.I have sensitive skin and was worried about trying a new product, but this serum is non-comedogenic and vegan, which made me feel confident about using it. The scent is subtle and luxurious, and the spray application is so convenient—perfect for a quick refresh during the day.After consistent use for a few weeks, my skin looks more radiant and feels incredibly soft. It has also helped to even out my skin tone and reduce the appearance of fine lines. I love that it's an all-in-one mist, saving me time and simplifying my skincare routine.Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high-quality, effective serum. It's worth every penny!	5
I have dry/normal skin but it gets clogged easily and I can break out when the product is too strong or heavy, but this. I put this spray on as a part of my skin care routine and i’m moisturized for 24 hours i tell you. I kinda douse my face in this too😋 Well I haven’t been leaving the house recently cuz i’m on winter break but from what I can tell this thing lasts on my face for ages. And aside from that, the glow LASTS😟 (like, after using it for two days, even if I don’t just newly spray the product on, I’m still glowing like mad) and my pores? GONE. My whiteheads are dissapearing too??? I don’t know what this company put in this thing but I haven’t broken out, i’m glowing even without it, and my complexion just got so much more even and more vibrant. Idk what that white truffle does but all ik is that I’d eat it bc I love mushrooms.But anyways, I bought it twice bc it was on sale and it’s the greatest product I’ve ever bought. It smells and looks expensive but it’s not all for show. You don’t need that dior tatcha chanel whatever kinda luxury brands. D’alba, although i’ve never heard of it before, is my new favorite brand.I was rlly looking for a new serum since I just started this whole korean skin care thing and I didn’t have one, but all the other ones on here just looked kinda boring/not effective according to the reviews or were too expensive. While you can, and if you have a similar skin type to mine, you should get it while it’s on sale.	5
Muy bueno	5
Absorbs into the skin nicely. Not heavy on skin.	5
Love that the product is delivered through a pump spray.  So easy to use.  Great to use before applying moisturizer to lock in moisture to the skin.	5
The quality of the packaging is absolutely amazing. The feel is heavy, luxury, and it feels good on my face. The weight is nice in your hand. And ease of use is absolutely amazing as well, you don't have to fight to get it to spray.	5
This spray serum is the best! I love it it’s the perfect amount of serum and hydration.	5
Love it!!  It hydrate me the whole day without feeling greasy and it smell do good!	5
me encanta este producto se me acaba y lo vuelvo a comprar	5
Fantastic!	5
Smells beautiful, feels beautiful and refreshing, looks beautiful!! High quality product.	5
Me encanto! Siento la piel super hidratada😍	5
I love this spray! I’m a guy that requires a bit of extra moisturizing on my face, so I spray a few spritz after applying my facial cream, it makes a nice natural looking sheen and I love it! Plus the smell is not too strong or girly. Highly recommend.	5
Me lo pongo después de lavar la cara y me deja bien fresca.	5
This was a pleasant surprise, especially used in conjunction with the serum and dual cream. It keeps my face feeling supple throughout the day and given me more 'good skin days' to go foundation-free. Will definitely repurchase.	5
I experienced a noticeable difference using this regularly on my skin.  I will continue to purchase this. It's not oily or greasy. It feels nourishing and light.	5
Doesn’t have odor it’s fabulous, leave your skins glowing! I love it. I’m going to order again.	5
No dislikes at all!!!	5
Me encantó el producto no esperaba menos tiene un olor exquisito y no se siente pesado en el rostro me gustó mucho sin duda lo compraría de nuevo	5
I bought this after I saw a Korean mom and daughter speak about it on TikTok. Needless to say I’m obsessed. It has made my skin look glowy and healthy, it also has a really nice smell to it, it calms me.	5
This was recommended by “ PAINTED BY SPENCER” on YOU TUBE.  I love watching his makeup tutorials.I have oily skin.  I shake the bottle and spray it as a setting spray.  Makeup stays on all day.  Love it does not make my face oily gives a nice subtle glow - I feel it’s just the right amount glow.  Does not make me break out.	5
Deja un rico aroma y hidrata	5
It’s work very well I recommend it 🥰🥰🥰🥰 great product	5
This really melts your makeup together as setting spray but leaves you face looking flawless and dewy not in a sweaty way. I also apply before makeup and it’s hydrating to the skin. It’s worth it. I don’t regret the impulse purchase	5
I was not expecting to like this product as much as I do. The mist is fine, not overly wet or greasy. Smells nice and perfumy. Good size, great value	5
